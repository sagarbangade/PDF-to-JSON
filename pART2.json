There isnone who is not inspired by taking Swamiji\u2019s name.Insurmountable difficulties have become opportunities forstupendous stories of success in the lives of millions whoread Swami Vivekananda. The life of Swamiji is Gita tomany. His life is an ideal to a youth, a patriot and a monk.Vivekananda Prakashan Trust is happy to present this reprintof the book published in 2005, in the midst of Swamiji\u2019s150th Birth Anniversary celebrations. This book has reachedmany and has become really a \u2018Comprehensive Biographyof Swami Vivekananda\u2019. Like the earlier versions we hopethis reprint also will serve the purpose of knowing Swamijiin-depth. The book is priced low to be affordable to many.To meet the demands of Hindi speaking, the translation ison, as is in Marathi.              -  Vivekananda Kendra Prakashan Trust, Chennai.     PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITIONIt is a welcome sign that the charm of Swami Vivekananda hasnot faded over the years; on the other hand, even after hundredand odd years of his passing away is not only remembered butalso debated and discussed by people all over the world. Hismessage is catching up as much in Western hemisphere as inEastern. Probably more. Even in his life time, both Americaand Europe had come under the influence of this \u201cCyclonicHindu Monk\u201d. Some of the top intellectuals were so fascinatedthat they wrote life sketches, though brief, about this \u2018Master\u2019with scanty material personally collected from the disciplesand in the course spread his message across the West. MaxMuller and Tolstoy were two of the most eminent among themwho wrote the biography of Sree Ramakrishna. Later on RomainRolland brought out one of the most scholarly biographies ofSwamiji which caught the imagination of the intellectuals allover. After a long interregnum of about seven decades ofindifference, if not hostility, in the erstwhile Soviet Union, studyof Swami Vivekananda has been revived in various centres.Considering all these, it is no wonder that there is a growingdemand for authentic biography as well as for scholarly studieson Swami Vivekananda whose relevance is growing with thepassage of time. Vivekananda Kendra is extremely happy tobring out the third reprint of \u201cThe Comprehensive Biographyof Swami Vivekananda\u201d by Dr. S. N. Dhar. Incidentally it alsoreveals how this two-volume-biography has appealed to thereading public all over India.The preface to the first edition was written by no less aperson than Sri R.C.Majumdar, the doyen of Indian History. Aquote from this eminent author is enough to highlight the qualityof the book.\u201cThe author has fully justified the title of the book, for Ibelieve it is the most comprehensive biography of SwamiVivekananda written in English. The author, an eminenthistorian, has approached his subject in a reverent but trulyhistoric spirit. He has narrated, in a simple language but ascritically as possible, the major events of the life of Swamijiand his principal activities - leaving the reader to form his ownconclusion on the personality and achievements of one of thegreatest men in modern Indian History\u201d.There is one reason why a truly comprehensive biographyof the Swami Vivekananda containing every bit of informationis made available to the public at this juncture of time. This isbecause concerted attempts are afoot to misrepresent the greatSwamiji and his vast contribution to suit ulterior purposes.People are free to evaluate and interpret great men from varyingperspectives but interpretations should be based on irrefutablefacts.  When this accepted norm is violated and facts areselectivelypicked up or omitted and interpretations foisted uponsuch basis, it is a great disservice not only to the presentgeneration but also to the posterity. Unfortunately such attemptshave been made deliberately by vested interests. Such motivatedfalsifications can be effectively countered only if all the factsare available to the public for reference. This is precisely whatthe \u201cComprehensive Biography\u201d effectively does. Hence it canbe safely stated that this valuable book fulfills an importantrequirement not only for the time being but for all times tocome.PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITIONVivekananda Kendra deems it a proud privilege to presentthese volumes before the public. Our hearts are full of gratitudeto the erudite author who is no more with us and also to thelarger number of readers and patrons who have made the reprintan urgent necessity. Two special features that would make thereprint more attractive than the earlier one needs to bementioned. The present edition is in three volumes, whichwould make it more handy for the users. Another feature is theinclusion of some very rare and hitherto unpublished Swamiji\u2019sphotos. We hope the readers will heartily welcome thesechanges. We are deeply indebted to the Sri RamakrishnaMission, Mylapore for kindly permitting us to utilise thesephotos.Let me end this preface by invoking an inimitablybeautiful passage from Romain Rolland\u2019s biography of SwamiVivekananda.\u201cHe was less than forty years of age when the athlete laystretched upon the pyre ....But the flame of that pyre is still alight today. From hisashes, like those of Phoenix of old, has sprung anew theconscience of India ..... faith in her unity and the Great Message,brooded over from Vedic times by the dreaming spirit of hisancient race - the message for which it must render account tothe rest of mankind\u201d.This reprint is a humble attempt in that direction.P.

            "data": "673But for a short visit to England (September-November, 1895)and the journey to and fro, Swami Vivekananda was in Americatill 15 April 1896, when he left for England on a second visit tothat country en route to India. During most of this time of nearlythree years of stay in America, Swamiji had little rest and hislife was one of unceasing lecturing and other kinds ofministration, which required him to travel up and down thecountry \u2014 to the borders of Canada one day and backward tosome city in the South on the day following \u2014 and sufferunimaginable hardships. By the role he played at the Parliamentof Religions at Chicago and by his subsequent work in Americaand England, Swami Vivekananda fulfilled the prophecy ofSri Ramakrishna that he would be a teacher to mankind. Heconsidered the Western nations to be fit recipients of themessage of Vedanta (fitter than even Indians) and he gave themof his best. Americans, one should think, were especiallyfortunate in this respect, being the first to receive his messageafter he had just completed his many years of toilsome sadhanasand wanderings as a monk, was in the peak of health, and wasbubbling over with the urge and enthusiasm to deliver it. Duringhis travels and ministrations in America, which we shall nowproceed to narrate, \u201che was\u201d, as Mrs. Burke observes,\u201cconsciously or unconsciously, fulfilling the function of a divineSWAMI VIVEKANANDA674prophet to America \u2014 scattering the seeds of spiritualitywherever he went and bestowing his blessing on innumerablemen and women\u201d.1The story of Swami Vivekananda\u2019s mission in the Westconsists of three parts. The first is a period of about six monthsbeginning from the close of the sessions of the Parliament ofReligions (27 September 1893) to about the first week of March1894, when he returned to Chicago, physically exhausted andquestioning to himself whether a change in his method of workwas not necessary. The second period, covering ten months,which may be considered as one of transition, extended up to27 January 1895, on which date he took up his residence at arented house in New York, and almost immediately beganholding classes there on Vedanta. The period which began withthe opening of the Vedanta classes and during which he triedto train up a few exceptional pupils in yoga, who might continuehis work in America after he had left, continued with a fewbreaks till 16 December 1896 when he set sail for home fromDover in England. This period includes his three brief visits toEngland, \u2014 September to November, 1895, April to July, 1896,and October to December, 1896. His second visit to America(26 August 1899 to 20 July 1900) was a sequel to this. In thisfirst period Swamiji was touring continuously (for a part of thetime under a contract with a lecture bureau and thenindependently), delivering lectures (sometimes numberingtwelve to fourteen and sometimes more a week), holdingdialogues and discussions with all who approached him forthe purpose and exhausting himself thoroughly. Unmindful ofthe campaign of calumny that the missionaries ceaselesslyconducted against him, and the strain that he was put to thatwrecked his health, he went on with his work.675Within a few months of his having started his life as alecturer at large, however, Swamiji found that it was not in hisgrains to live it. As early as 18 March 1894 he wrote to MaryHale that though he was being called the \u201ccyclonic\u201d Hindu hewas not at all \u201ccyclonic\u201d, and that he could not bear the\u201ccyclonic\u201d atmosphere. He thought that he was neither a writernor a speaker but that he could think deeply and, when heated,could speak fire, though that was \u201cto a select, a very selectfew\u201d. \u201cMy idea of doing good\u201d, said he, \u201cis this: to evolve outa few giants, and not to strew pearls before the swine\u201d.2 Hewas tired and disgusted with the fame that he had acquired andhe felt that the interest he had awakened was superficial. Hedesired to gather round him some earnest minded followerswhom he could teach free, while living independently in a placeof his own. That was why, as we have said above, he eventuallyrented a house in New York and announced classes and lecturesfree of charge. Against the wishes of some of his rich admirers,who warned that \u201cthe right kind of people\u201d could not come toattend his classes if they were not held in some house in the\u201cright\u201d quarters, the house that was rented for the purpose forhim by his disciple, Leon Landsberg, was in 54 West Thirty-third Street, where the poorest of the New York populationlived. The change in his method of work did not, however,come about immediately and there was, as we have said above,a period of transition. Though the New York classes began on27 January 1895, when he took up his residence in his house inthe city (or perhaps on the day following), the idea of a changein his method of work was getting hold of his mind for somemonths earlier. He had already held classes, seated under apine tree at Greenacre during July-August, 1894 and between5 and 28 December, 1894 in Mrs. Bull\u2019s house at Cambridge.It was perhaps his experience of these classes that finallyconvinced him about the need for a change of plan.IN AND AROUND CHICAGOSWAMI VIVEKANANDA676Proceeding to narrate Swami Vivekananda\u2019s activitiesafter the Chicago Parliament, we find him staying for sometime (possibly for some two months, or more) at Chicago beforelaunching on a \u2018cyclonic\u2019 tour of lecturing in some of what areknown as the Midwest, Southern and Eastern States. He visitedabout a dozen of these States. They were Illinois, Michigan,Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Tennesse, Massachusetts, NewYork, Maine, Maryland, and Pennsylvania. In modern times,the life of a people, is determined more by economic conditionsthan anything else, and it is customary to speak of a country asdivided from the economic point of view into a number of\u201cregions\u201d having common economic interests rather thanpolitically into states and, similarly the \u201cregions\u201d as dividedinto \u201cmetropolitan areas\u201d rather than into \u201ccities\u201d. (Theboundaries of a city are political and they may be drawnarbitrarily through well populated places. A metropolitan area,on the contrary, is an entire cluster of urban population aboutone centre. It may include only one city and its suburbs, or itmay include several cities close together which make up onepopulation and economic unit.) Speaking in these terms, SwamiVivekananda\u2019s mission during his first visit to America coveredthe regions known as the Southeast (in which lies Memphis inTennessee), the Central Basin (in which are included the Statesof Illinois minus the coastal belt in which Chicago is situated,Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Iowa), and the Northeast (whichincludes the coastal belt of Illinois, in which Chicago is situated,Michigan, Massachusetts, New York, Maryland and Maine),which Swamiji visited. We shall, however, while speaking ofSwamiji\u2019s tours, continue to use such terms as the Midwest,the South, the East, etc., as they are well established and havebeen by previous writers on the subject.677It was the Northeast which was the chief sphere of SwamiVivekananda\u2019s activities during his first visit to America, andit is this region which is one of those that have the greatestimportance in the life of the American people. Of the ten largestmetropolitan areas in the United States seven are in this region,including New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit, Bostonand Baltimore, where Swamiji moved to and fro and heldclasses or delivered lectures. New York City is the hub of thispredominantly industrial region. The Northeast is the part ofthe United States which most visitors see and the part that ismost often described. This is the part also that owes the heaviestto Europe, being the one into which millions of Europeanscame, who made of it what became known as \u201cthe meltingpot\u201d, or the fusion of many people into what are known asAmericans. In this area are big and famous cities with millsand factories and skyscrapers as also wooded hills, tilled fields,and twinkling lights from farmhouses. The cities \u2014 so big, sobusy, so complex, \u2014 are hard for the human mind to graspeasily. But, in contrast, the features of the landscape over mostof this region are of a small and gentle scale. It is a countrysideof many brooks, of lazily undulating mountain ridges, oforchards, pastures and vegetable gardens. Working hard in thecongested cities, Swamiji occasionally found relief inswimming, yachting, or resting in nature\u2019s lovely surroundings.          IIWe last saw Swamiji being escorted to the office of theParliament of Religions by Mrs. George W. Hale and then forseventeen days attending the sessions of the Parliament. Wheredid he stay during these days? In the life 3 it was stated that \u201conthe very day that he was suddenly raised to glory\u201d, he wasIN AND AROUND CHICAGOSWAMI VIVEKANANDA678\u201cinvited\u201d by \u201ca certain gentleman of wealth and distinction\u201d tolive at his house and that (as we have described above) hespent his \u201cfirst night\u201d most unhappily there, pondering overthe contrast between the luxurious living in America and themisery of the life of the Indian masses. From the reminiscencesof Cornelia Conger, a granddaughter of this gentleman, whichwas published in the Prabuddha Bharata in May 1956,4 it isknown that this  gentleman was Mr. J.B.Lyon, who was one ofthe elite of the city who had volunteered to ask into their homesas guests delegates to the Parliament. Mr. Lyon had also askedthat the delegate sent to him be a broadminded man since,interested as he was in philosophy, he heartily disliked bigots.Cornelia Conger gives an interesting account of Swamiji\u2019s stayat the house beginning with his being brought there by a memberof their Church (the First Presbyterian) sometime \u201caftermidnight\u201d. We are very thankful to her for giving to the worldher reminiscences of Swamiji but, as at the time (1893) shewas only six years old and she told the story in 1956 when shewas sixty-five years old and did so presumably only frommemory, there are naturally some lacunae.She does not give the date on which Swamiji first cameto the house, but one may from what is stated in The Life, viz.,that he came there in the evening of the day he was raised toglory, i.e., the 11th, or, Cornelia Conger states explicitly, aftermidnight, that he came in the early hours of the 12th September.But one little difficulty remains. Cornelia Conger says that whenher grandmother first saw who had been sent to her house,viz., Swamiji (a coloured man), she became worried becausein her house at that time she had a few guests who wereSoutherners, who had a strong dislike for associating withanyone but whites. To finish this part of the story, she told herhusband about her problem as soon as he woke up next morning,679adding that she might put Swamiji up as their guest at theAuditorium Hotel nearby. The old gentleman met Swamiji andafter a few minutes\u2019 conversation with him, returned to hiswife and said \u201cI don\u2019t care a bit, Emily, if all our guests leave.This Indian is the most brilliant and interesting man who hasever been in our home, and he shall stay as long as he wishes\u201d.So Swamiji stayed there during the Parliament days, callingMrs. Lyon \u201cmother\u201d (she being one of the few women inAmerica, whom he so addressed, and the others being Mrs.Belle Hale, Mrs. Betty Leggett and Mrs. Sara Chapman OleBull). Swamiji found in Mrs. Lyon his own mother, she beingin physical appearance, like the latter, rather short of statureand having a `regal gait\u2019. Returning to the little difficulty aboutwhich we have spoken above, if Swamiji really came in theevening of the 11th, or the early hours of the 12th, i.e., after hehad made a name in the Parliament, Mrs. Lyon, who perhapshad attended the meeting and been one of the thousands whohad cheered him would not have found in him a stranger, and,in any case, the clergyman who brought him to the house shouldhave made some reference to what Swamiji had said and donein the Parliament in the previous afternoon. We may expectMr. Lyon, who had shown such an interest in the Parliamentthat he had asked into his house a delegate as his guest, also tohave attended the opening session of the Parliament. It wouldtherefore seem that Swamiji came to Mr. Lyon\u2019s house in theevening of the 10th, or the early hours of the 11th September.The point, however, is not an important one, and we can onlysay that we are not sure about the date.Cornelia Conger, who was a little child when Swamijicame to their house, was naturally a favourite, and she tells ushow fond she was of him. She would climb to his lap and askhim to tell her a story. Swamiji would tell her enchanting storiesIN AND AROUND CHICAGOSWAMI VIVEKANANDA680Mr. John B LyonMrs. John B Lyon681Chicago, September 1893IN AND AROUND CHICAGOSWAMI VIVEKANANDA682Chicago, September 1893683Chicago, September 1893IN AND AROUND CHICAGOSWAMI VIVEKANANDA684of India, of monkeys, peacocks and banyan trees and marketsfull of fruits and vegetables. At times, however, when Swamijiwas in meditation, she felt that he did not want to be disturbedand had somehow become different. She was fascinated bySwamiji\u2019s turban, which she thought was a funny kind of a hatthat needed to be wound up afresh every time he put it on. Shepersuaded him to let her see him wrap it back and forth aroundhis head. She tells us how one day Swamiji, who was fond ofhot dishes, lavishly sprinkled Tabasco Sauce on his meat andalarmed her grandmother (a story we have narrated in Chapter2). She also tells us a few stories which give us an idea of thehappy time spent by an Indian \u2018son\u2019 with his American \u2018mother\u2019\u2014 indicating that where the heart beats true, differences ofcolour of skin, etc., vanish and mankind is one family.Swamiji would bring to Mrs. Lyon tied up in ahandkerchief (for he had no purse) all the money people gavehim as donation at the end of some lecture (we shall say moreabout this later). After the coins had been counted and the totalwritten down by Swamiji, Mrs. Lyon would deposit the amountfor him in the bank. Once Swamiji told her that he had thegreatest temptation of his life in America. In pleasant goodhumour, she asked, \u201cWho is she, Swami?\u201d and Swamiji,bursting out in a loud laugh, told her it was not a woman hehad fallen in love with but the Americans\u2019 skill in organizingall work they undertook. It seems it was not only because sheliked to tease Swamiji a little that she had asked him whetherhe had fallen in love and put the direct question, \u201cWho is she?\u2019\u2019She had noticed that some American girls, who had anopportunity of meeting Swamiji, were attracted by hispersonality and was afraid that Swamiji who was quiteunworldly, was unaware that he might be put to a false anduncomfortable position in consequence. The good lady was685genuinely worried and one day she did caution him about it.Her concern touched and amused him and he patted her handand said, \u201cDear Mrs. Lyon, you dear American mother of mine,don\u2019t be afraid for me. It is true that I often sleep under a banyantree with a bowl of rice given to me by a kindly peasant, but itis equally true that I also am sometimes the guest in the palaceof a great Maharaja and a save girl is appointed to wave apeacock feather fan over me all night long. I am  used totemptation and you need not fear for me\u201d. In a letter to hisfriend, Manmatha Nath Bhattacharya, dated 5 September 1894,Swamiji wrote thus about American women who attempted toflirt with him and how he dealt with them. \u201cThe women inAmerica,\u201d said he, \u201care very sentimental and have a mania forromance. I am, however, a strange sort of animal who has notany romantic feelings, and therefore they could not sustain anysuch feeling towards me and they show me great respect. Imade all of them call me \u201cfather\u201d, or \u201cbrother\u201d. I don\u2019t allowthem to come near me with any other feelings and graduallythey have been straightened out\u201d.5Swami Vivekananda left the Lyons\u2019 home as soon as, orsoon after the Parliament ended its sessions but he stayed on atChicago for about two months, or more, though we do notknow exactly at what places he stayed, or the details of whathe did at this time. After the celebrity that the Parliament hadgiven him, the doors of many wealthy and fashionable homeswere open to him and he seems to have been for some timemuch lionized in American society.6 In a letter to Prof. Wrightdated 2 October 1893 he wrote, \u201cSomebody or other gives meshelter and food and somebody or other comes to ask me tospeak about Him and I know He sends them and mine is toobey. And then He is supplying my necessities and His will bedone\u201d. He also said that he was moving about just then andIN AND AROUND CHICAGOSWAMI VIVEKANANDA686that only when he came to Chicago he made it a point to lookup Mr. and Mrs. Lyon, his postal address being c/o. Mr. J. B.Lyon, 262 Michigan Avenue. During this time, off and on, heseems to have lived as the guest of the Hales at their home at541 Dearborn Avenue, as may be surmised from the fact thathis letter to Mrs. Woods dated 19 November 1893 is writtenon stationery bearing that letterhead. He may have sometimeslived in hotels also, which left him free to receive persons whocame  to him for help and where he could have his own regimeof food and many hours of meditation. Some of his countrymen,whom he pointed out to the reporter of the Boston EveningTranscript (see above) with the remark that they would takecare of him, may have paid some of his hotel bills, but probablyat this time he himself was earning enough to be able to paythem.He fully utilized his comparatively leisurely stay atChicago after the strenuous labours of the Parliament days, bynot only giving occasional lectures (speaking about Him, as hewrote to Prof. Wright) but in studying American civilization.He specially enquired into the conditions making for Americanmaterial prosperity for, as when he had come to America, hehad conceived it to be his task to interpret the spiritual cultureof India to Americans, and he looked forward to acquaintIndians, when he returned home, with the factors thatcontributed to the material advancement of the Westerncountries. He thus seems to be fully awake to what was thechief purpose of his mission \u2014 to interpret the East to theWest and the West to the East with a view to finding out ameans to their fusion and reconciliation. This \u2014 the realsignificance of his mission \u2014 became more and morepronounced as time went on, but at this time his unhappymotherland being the uppermost in his mind, he made a special687study of American educational institutions \u2014 education beinghis panacea for the evils the masses in India suffered from. Asregards the lectures he delivered at Chicago at this time weknow little, besides the fact that, as may be gathered from aletter he wrote to Prof. Wright on 26 October 1893, on thefollowing day (27 October) he delivered a lecture on Buddhismat the ladies\u2019 fortnightly club, which was the most influentialclub in the city.Thanks to some recent researches, however, we knowsomething about Swamiji\u2019s lecture engagements in someneighbouring places. We learn, firstly, that he delivered threelectures at Evanston, a beautiful residential city adjoiningChicago on the north by the side of Lake Michigan. He hadalready been once to the city (3 October) to meet Dr. Bradely,a friend of Prof. Wright. Swamiji\u2019s lectures at Evanston weredelivered in conjunction with Dr. Carlvon Borgen, a fellowdelegate at the Parliament who hailed from Sweden, and whoalso delivered three lectures. The lectures had been announcedin the Evanston papers on 23 September, four days before theclose of the Parliament and in nature resembled and were asort of an overflow of the work done in the Parliament. Thetitles of Swamiji\u2019s lectures were Hindu Altruism (31 October),Monism (3 November) and Reincarnation (5 October). TheEvanston Index of 7 October, reporting the lecture onreincarnation, observed that it was \u201cvery interesting, the viewsbeing those that are not often heard in this part of the world\u201d. Itis a topic on which Swamiji spoke on many occasions, anddealt with in extenso in an article Reincarnation, which hecontributed to the Metaphysical Magazine, New York, March1895. (C. W., cited VII, 454ff.)IN AND AROUND CHICAGOSWAMI VIVEKANANDA688The report of the Evanston Index on the lecture, thoughbrief, gives the main arguments of Swamiji quite clearly, andwe give some of them here. \u201cThe main point to be decided,\u201dSwamiji is reported to have said, \u201cis, as to whether we havehad a past\u201d. \u201cWe know that we have a present and feel sure ofa future. Yet how can there be a present without a past?\u201d heargued. He clinched the argument by saying, \u201cModern scienceproves that matter exists and continues to exist. Creation ismerely a change in appearance. We are not sprung out ofnothing. Some regard God as the common cause of everythingand judge this a sufficient reason for existence. But ineverything we must consider the phenomena; whence and fromwhat matter springs. The same arguments that prove that thereis a future prove that there is a past. It is necessary that thereshould be causes other than God\u2019s will\u201d. He discussed whetherheredity may provide a sufficient explanation and his conclusionwas negative. Then why do we not remember our past lives?\u201cSome say that we are not conscious of a former existence.Many cases have been found where there are distinctreminiscences of the past. And here lies the germ of the theory\u201d.From Swamiji\u2019s letter to Mrs. Woods dated 10 October18937 it is known that he had delivered a lecture, or perhaps aseries of lectures, at Streator for he informed her that he \u201cgot $87 for a lecture\u201d. However, only one lecture, which wasdelivered at the Plump Opera House, was reported in theStreator Daily Press of 9 October. The lecture was well attendedand was described by the paper as \u201cvery interesting\u201d, thoughthe report, says Mrs. Burke, was \u201csomewhat dreary\u201d, indicatingthat \u201cthe American press, for one reason or another, did notalways give Swamiji an enthusiastic reception\u201d. The lectureseems to have been on Swamiji\u2019s favourite subject, \u201cMannersand Customs of India\u201d and from the paper\u2019s comment that \u201cit689was lamentably short and that much was left unsaid of seeminggreater importance than much that was said\u201d we may infer thathe had not found the audience to be of a highly intellectualorder, for he generally refrained from \u201cstrewing pearls beforethe swine\u201d. At Evanston which, though a small place, had auniversity, he had spoken on philosophical subjects, \u201cAdvaita\u201d,\u201cReincarnation\u201d, and \u201cHindu Altruism\u201d. The lecture at Streator,however, seems to have covered a wide variety of topics \u2014caste, varnasrama, social customs, etc. of the Hindus, whichhe \u201cmildly defended\u201d, presumably by reference to the fact thatthey had stood the test of time. According to the report, he\u201cboasted that the India of today was the same India that hadwatched for centuries the meteoric  nations of the world flashacross the horizon and sink into oblivion.\u201d (Streator was a smalltown on the Vermillion River in the La Salle county of Illinois,and about 90 miles southwest of Chicago. It is in the heart ofthe Corn Belt and the Vermillion coalfield. Mining on a largescale had been begun in 1866 by the Vermillion Coal Company,whose president was W. L .Streator, after whom the place wasnamed. In 1882, Streator, with a population of 6000, waschartered as a city.)From scattered sources, we have some pleasing glimpsesof Swamiji during this period when he was mostly at Chicagoand only occasionally visiting places near about for deliveringlectures. Wherever he stayed, in private homes as guest, or inhotels, much of his time was spent in meditation. His sadhanaswere so intensive at times that, as we have stated in Chapter 4,his mind sometimes drifted to nirvikalpa samadhi and at leastonce it almost lost itself in this state when, it is said, it waspulled up by the intervention of Sri Ramakrishna, who appearedbefore him in material form and reminded him about his missionon earth.8 When not actually practising meditation, he still feltIN AND AROUND CHICAGOSWAMI VIVEKANANDA690God\u2019s presence everywhere \u2014 even in the rush of business inAmerica (as he wrote to Prof.Wright) \u2014 and knew he wasdoing His work as guided by Him. In a poem he had enclosedin a letter to Prof. Wright (4 September 1893) he had spoken ofGod as \u201cstanding by\u201d when children are at play. In his letterdated October 18939, he speaks of Him, in a postscript whichhe addressed to Prof. Wright\u2019s little son, Austin, still moreintimately \u2014 as playmate. \u201cDear Austin,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwhenyou are playing, there is another playmate playing with youwho loves you more than anybody else; and Oh, He is so fullof fun. He is always playing \u2014 sometimes with great big ballswhich we call the sun and earth, sometimes with little childrenlike you and laughing and playing with you. How funny it wouldbe to see Him and play with Him, my dear, think of it\u201d.          IIIWith the growth of spirituality, a sadhaka, it is believed, acquirescertain \u201cpowers\u201d, which help him further in his sadhanas andalso enable him to benefit others. Quite often, however, thesense of their possession and their indiscriminate use makethe unwary sadhaka stray from the right path and thus lead tohis downfall. Exaggerated, and often false, stories of the miraclemaking powers of Indian yogis were widespread in the West,leading to a veritable craze for them that was not confinedonly to the uneducated multitude. That they have some basisin fact, being testified to by many yogis, including SriAurobindo, who has himself narrated how, while confined in asolitary cell by the orders of then foreign government, he oncefound himself in a state of levitation (the body being voluntarilyraised above the ground), has, unfortunately, led to the raisingof the numerous cock-and-bull stories regarding them. The boyNaren, as we have seen, was once offered these \u201cpowers\u2019\u2019 by691his guru, who was only too glad when he refused to have them.Shortly before he passed away, however, Sri Ramakrishnatransmitted all his \u201cpowers\u201d to Naren who, by his own sadhanas,was also acquiring them.During his stay in America, Swami Vivekananda wasasked by many people about these \u201cpowers\u201d, sometimes bypersons having a genuine scientific interest in the phenomenabut more often by curiosity hunters, and sometimes by peoplewho considered it a good method for embarrassing and\u201cexposing\u201d him. During his wanderings in India, SwamiVivekananda had come across some people who apparentlywere in possession of \u201cmiraculous\u201d powers, such as the man atHyderabad (whose  story we have narrated in Chapter 6, SectionX above) who produced fruits, flowers, even steaming rice outof the air as it were (the man himself declaring they were meresleights-of-hand). Swami Vivekananda had a scientific interestin these alleged feats of miracle making and thought they wereworth studying with an unbiased mind. He gave his thoughtson the subject in a lecture he delivered at Los Angeles(California) on 8 January 1900 (see Chapter 14, Section V,below). Always, however, he declared that these feats hadnothing to do with religion and that miracles were the greateststumbling blocks in the way of truth. As he told a reporter ofthe Memphis Commercial (15 January 1894), \u201cWe do notbelieve in miracles at all but that apparently strange thingsmay be accomplished under the operation of natural laws. . . .Thought reading and the foretelling of events are successfullypracticed by the Hath yogis\u201d. He told this reporter that he hadnever seen anyone overcome gravitation (by levitation) but thathe had seen many who were trying to do so. As to suspendedanimation he told him that he himself had known a man whowent into a sealed cave, which was then closed, and remainedSWAMIJI AND PSYCHIC POWERSSWAMI VIVEKANANDA692there for many years without food. He also said that the storyof the man in India who was buried with a crop of barley raisedover his grave and who was finally taken out alive was wellauthenticated.10Though it is hard to believe it, there is a story that Swamijigave a demonstration of materialization at the house of Mrs.J.B. Bagley where he stayed as a guest in February, 1894. Thestory was narrated to Mrs. Burke out of her memory by Mrs.J.B. Bagley\u2019s granddaughter, Mrs. Frances Bagely Wallace who,it may be noted, was only a small child when the allegedincident occurred. Mrs. Wallace\u2019s story is as follows: \u201cI wasonly nine years old at the time, but I remember that after beinglocked in the grandfather\u2019s study at one end of the house, theSwami materialized in the centre of the big parlour at the otherend of the house where the guests were. When the prominentgentleman who had locked him in the study and had pocketedthe key returned and unlocked the door, there sat the Swami inthe same position as he had been when they had locked him inthere\u201d. As Mrs. Burke rightly observes, it is difficult to believethat Swamiji would have submitted himself to such a test ofhis powers, or would have used those powers to entertain andastound his friends. What is also surprising is that the storyescaped the sleuths of the press and even the editor of theEvening News, who had greeted Swamiji at his arrival inDetroit, in an article in its 14 February issue entitled \u201cGive ussome miracles\u201d, with the demand that he should either \u201cput upor shut up\u201d, that is, either prove that he actually possessed themiracle making powers that Indian yogis are credited with, orconfess that he was no yogi. If the demonstration ofmaterialization that Mrs. Wallace speaks of had taken place onthe reception day, viz., 14 February, we should have expectedto find some reference to it in the controversy started in the693columns of this paper in protest against the \u201cbrutal andblasphemous\u201d cry of the editor, \u201cGive us some miracles\u201d.Indeed, one of Swamiji\u2019s ablest defenders, Mr. O. P. Deldoc,denying that an honest religious preacher must also possessmiracle making powers to entitle him to expound his faith,asked, 16 February 1894, \u201cShall we send our sectarianmissionaries to his land, and kick him out of ours because,forsooth, he can\u2019t hoodoo us with some hocus-pocus tricks, orshow us what never existed \u2014 a miracle?\u201dHowever improbable it may appear to us that Swamijigave a demonstration of the kind that Mrs. Wallace has spokenof (she is definite regarding the authenticity of her memory),the phenomenon of materialization is not unknown, and thereader may recall a story, narrated by us along with a few othersin an earlier Chapter, of Sri Ramakrishna having appeared atthe same time in two places, viz., Dakshineswar and Dacca(See Chapter 4, Section X and Note No. 112 appended to theChapter). As regards Swamiji himself, we have it from SriAurobindo that while he was in his solitary cell at Alipur, heheard Swami Vivekananda\u2019s voice speaking to him for afortnight, during which he also felt his presence. In a talk atPondicherry on 10 July 1926, Sri Aurobindo reverted to thesubject and said, \u201cVivekananda came and gave me theknowledge of intuitive mentality . . . . The contact lasted forabout three weeks and then he withdrew\u201d.11In any case, during this time and at certain subsequentperiods of his stay in the West, Swamiji felt that certain yogicpowers had spontaneously developed in him.12 He rarely usedthem, and in the few cases that he did so, it was not for nameor fame but to help a truly good soul, too feeble to rise abovesome weakness and evil influences. He could change, if he soSWAMIJI AND PSYCHIC POWERSSWAMI VIVEKANANDA694wished, the whole trend of a man\u2019s life by his mere touch. Hecould see things occurring at great distances. By the mercy ofSri Ramakrishna, as he wrote to Mrs. Bull, 25 April 1895, hedistinctly \u201csized up\u201d almost infallibly a human face as soon ashe saw it.13 On many occasion, his students would find himanswering and solving those very doubts and questions thatthey would be thinking of at the moment. The story is told howone day at Chicago a man spoke flippantly about yogic powersand challenged him, if he could, to tell him something of hismental makeup, or his past. The Swami hesitated for a moment,and then fixed his eyes on those of the man, whereupon thelatter felt that some irresistible power was piercing throughhis body to his soul as it were, and in alarm cried out, \u201cO Swami,what are you doing to me? It seems as if my whole soul isbeing churned and all the secrets of my life called up in strongcolours\u201d. However, such cases of the deliberate use of hispowers  by the Swami were, as we have said above, very rareand, it would seem, refer mostly to the period of his early daysin the West. In India, he generally discouraged even his closestand most devoted disciples in their belief that he had anymiraculous powers. His disciple Sarat Chandra Chakravarti,has narrated how one day he and Swami Suddhananda pressedhim to be to them what Sri Ramakrishna had been to hisdisciples, Kapalamochana (one who can undo the decrees offate). He only replied, \u201cI give you blessing. . . . Let the Masterpour upon you his favours. I do not know if I can pronounce onyou a higher blessing than this\u201d.14The hour had now struck at long last when the Swamiwas to embark on his mission in the West. His Master hadbegun his work of ministration when his arduous twelve-yearperiod of sadhanas had ended. Before he arrived in America,Swami Vivekananda had gone through his own years of695strenuous sadhanas, and he had landed on American soil \u2014the flame of spirituality burning within him \u2014 ready to givehumanity a share of what he had acquired. The Parliament ofReligions had made him widely known in America but, inperspective, it was, as he said once, little more than an opening,an opportunity, a first step, or even something by the way. Hisreal work, his life\u2019s mission, begins now. As the Master haddone at Dakshineswar, he was now to open the casket in whichlay locked pearls and gems of ancient Indian wisdom andspirituality to the view of the world and offer them to all. HisMaster had asserted that Naren would be a teacher of humanity,as willed by the Divine Mother. He himself had been long awarethat he had \u201cwork to do\u201d, and he had prayed to the DivineMother to show him the way to do it. When he heard about theAmerican\u2019s preparations for holding a Parliament of Religions,he had instantly recognized  the divine hand that was workingbehind it and beckoning him to proceed to carry out the divinepurpose.As we have said above, he gave Americans of his best;without being generally aware of it, it was their luck to receivewhat he gave them. There was a feeling among some of hisdisciples in India that his own countrymen had a greater claimon him and that he should cut short his ministration in the Westand return to India. He himself considered his life as at theservice of the Divine Mother, who was the Mother of theUniverse and of whom all people, be they inhabitants of theEast or the West, equally were children. He had addressed hisaudience on the opening day of the Parliament as sisters andbrothers and they had warmly responded because they werenot mere words that he had uttered, but truth. When one readsthe stories that are recorded in works on his life, etc., about thewarmth with which he was welcomed into American homesSWAMIJI AND PSYCHIC POWERSSWAMI VIVEKANANDA696\u2014 about how their young boys and girls looked upon him astheir brother, elderly people like Mr. and Mrs. J.B. Lyon, Mr.and Mrs. G.W. Hale, Mrs. Ole Bull, Mrs. Leggett, Dr. and Mrs.Guernsey, etc., looked upon him as their son, and thousandswho met him and heard him, found in him their friend, mentorand even guru \u2014 one wonders. Mrs. Burke says that Swamijihad \u201cspecial friends\u201d like these in the large cities of America.She thinks that they were there by divine providence \u201cfor inthe life of one so very close to God this seems to be an almostcosmic design, both broad and detailed\u201d.15 Be that as it may,our amazement is all the greater because, specially in thosedays, race prejudice was very strong and Indians, to a greatextent because they were a conquered race, were looked downupon, even if not regarded, like Africans,16 as a subhumanspecies, and there were all sorts of misrepresentations of themin the Western World. One wonders also to read how Swamiji,just  coming out of a country under foreign subjugation, whereeven an Anglo-Indian ticket checker looked upon and oftentreated the most respected Indian as his inferior, and the highestamong Indians had often to kowtow before the pettiest amongthe white rulers, \u2014 could be so free of the bane of inferioritycomplex as to treat the Americans, from the multimillionaireRockefeller to the humblest Negro porter, on a footing ofequality, could feel as being one of them and give to everybodythe sympathy, love and respect that was his due.Some stories are told about this period Swamiji\u2019s staythat illustrate the above, and however unimportant they appearto be in the story of his mission in America that begins now, itappears to us worthwhile, before we take up the latter, to narratea few of them. We have already told the story of little Corneliaconfidently climbing up to Swamiji\u2019s lap and asking him totell her a few stories. Another little child had her bellyful of697stories from Swamiji daily for some time at Chicago when hermother, whose name we do not know, went out for marketingand, happening to see him seated in a park through which shepassed, thought he was kind and trustworthy and left her in hischarge for the while. When the child had grown to be fifteen orsixteen, her mother came upon a picture of Swamiji, now afamous man, showed it to her and asked her if she rememberedher friend. She did, and as we further know, later in life, shehappened to meet Swami Akhilananda who at the time visitedChicago now and then and became his student. As Mrs. Burkeobserves, there are many more stories that have not been toldyet of persons receiving Swamiji\u2019s holy contact, be it only atouch, or a glance, that led them upward.17When Swamiji was lecturing at the Unitarian Church atDetroit (February, 1894), he perhaps little knew how the seedof spirituality was being implanted in the hearts of many of hislisteners. One of the latter, who became later known as  SisterChristine and, \u201cof all his Western disciples, was to be withSister Nivedita the closest to his thought\u201d,18 underwent a soultransformation. One Miss Marguerite Cook, who was a teacherin a school in the city, was so moved to hear his lectures that,ordinarily unimpressionable by nature, for the first time in herlife she felt an impulse to congratulate the speaker. Shakinghands with Swamiji after the lecture, she felt suddenlyoverwhelmed and could not speak. She could not bear to washher hand for three days. We have read about another personwho was seized with a similar awe at the touch of Swamiji, aboy who later became a Professor of Philosophy at theHazaribagh College, Bihar. The story refers to a later date butmay be narrated here, the context being an appropriate one.(The event may have happened towards the end of DecemberSWAMIJI AND PSYCHIC POWERSSWAMI VIVEKANANDA6981898, when Swamiji was at Deoghur, and suffering fromasthma.)19The story was narrated by Prof. K.S. Ghosh forty yearsafter the event had happened, when he had retired from service.In 1898 he, a student of the Matriculation class of theBaidyanath Deoghur High School, learned that Swamiji hadcome to the place for reasons of health. With a chum, he wentout to meet Swamiji and, coming across him rather suddenlyas he was stepping out of the house where he was residing,they stooped low to touch his feet. Swamiji, Mr. Ghosh tellsus, quickly stepped back and did not allow them to touch hisfeet. He asked them to walk along with him and, as they didso, went on talking with them in a very familiar way. He talkednot on religion, but on health, hygiene and sanitation \u2014 makingpersonal enquiries and giving them advice on these subjects.Pointing to the hills that stood majestically against the westernhorizon at some distance, Swamiji asked them if they had beenthere for excursion and, learning that they had not yet done so,asked them to do  so as soon as possible, remarking thatexcursions were both healthy and refreshing.Swamiji enquired about the food arrangements in theirhostel and, learning that the boys took a good amount of gheedaily, said that butter was preferable. He went on chatting and,when Ghosh told him incidentally that he belonged to EastBengal, he said that he had been to those parts years ago andhad found that people there had a sufficient amount of goodfish in their daily diet, which he approved. Now, by chance,Swamiji\u2019s eyes fell on the shoes that Ghosh was wearing, andhe noticed that the latchets had been tied wrongly (the ends ofthe two latchets were turned the same way). He asked the boyto do it correctly and, finding him confused, stooped low and699said, \u201cWell, let me do it\u201d. Ghosh mechanically put forward hisright leg towards the Swami, who tied the latchets correctly,keeping the two ends in opposite directions. Swamiji askedhim to do the other shoe properly but Ghosh became furtherconfused and could not act as he had suggested. His witsreturning to himself, he tried to atone for his unconscious andseeming disobedience by trying to touch his feet, but Swamijistepped back and did not allow him to do so. When they returnedto the hostel, the story spread quickly and \u201cstreams of friendscame out to examine the latchet which had been sanctified bythe touch of Swamiji\u201d. Even in his old age when he narratedthe story for the Prabuddha Bharata, Prof. Ghosh did not findwords adequate enough to describe the condition of blessednessin which he felt he was at the time. He simply states that hisfellow hostellers would not allow him to untie the latchet, which\u201cwas, however, done late at night not without misgivings andwith heavy heart\u201d20We go back to the days of Swamiji\u2019s stay in Chicagoafter the Parliament of Religions, or more exactly to March-April, 1894 when, after going through his two strenuous andtriumphant lecture programmes at Detroit and elsewhere, hewas resting for a while at the city, and stories of his \u201cgreat andsaving spiritual power\u201d had spread so much that many peoplecame to him seeking help and guidance. Among the latter wasthe famous operatic singer, Emma Calve (18651942), who atthe time was visiting Chicago with the Metropolitan OperaCompany. Born at Decazeville, Averyron (France), and trainedat Paris, she had made her first important appearance at Brusselsin 1882. She sang mainly in Paris for some years, but in 1892she came to London and attained immediate fame andpopularity at Covent Garden, more specially by her wonderfulCarmen in Bizet\u2019s opera, a part with which her name will beSWAMIJI AND PSYCHIC POWERSSWAMI VIVEKANANDA700always associated. (Carmen is a tale of a Spanish subject,published in 1847, by Prosper Merimee, 1803-70, a Frenchnovelist. On a version of this by Meilhac and Halevy, Bizet,1838-75, wrote an opera, which was his masterpiece. Carmenwas first produced at the Opera Comique in 1875.)The young and handsome songbird who charmed heraudiences with her magnificent voice in two continents had amost miserable personal history. She, it would seem, hid hertears and calmed the tumult raging in her heart by giving herselfentirely to her art, to all outward appearances ordinarilysucceeding in doing so. But, passionate and headstrong, shefrom time to time got involved in emotional attachments, whichnever lasted long, and what still saved her through all thesetrials and disappointments was her love for her daughter, anonly child, on whom all her affections were centred. When shecame to Swamiji, two cruel blows had fallen on her \u2014 themost recent of her emotional episodes had come to an unhappyend and, while she was giving her performance one evening atthe opera, she received the news that her child had been burnedto death. She collapsed as soon as she heard that her child wasno more  and, when she was brought to, she had nothing in lifeto live for. A number of times she attempted to commit suicideand could not do so, because a friend, who was always withher and consoled her, prevented her from doing so. The latterbegged her to see Swamiji. She constantly refused but eachtime she went out of her house to drown herself in the lake, shefound, as though in a daze, taking the way to the house of afriend, with whom Swamiji was staying at the time. Thishappened probably in March, 1894.We have the story of Mme. Calve\u2019s first meeting withSwamiji from herself.21 Coming to the house, either by701appointment, or casually, she was immediately ushered intoSwamiji\u2019s room and, finding him seated in an attitude ofmeditation, with his eyes fixed to the ground, she waited insilence for a moment, since she had been told that she shouldnot speak till he addressed her. After a brief pause, withoutlooking up, Swamiji said, \u201cMy child, what a troubledatmosphere you have about you. Be calm. It is essential\u201d. Then,as she stood silent, he narrated \u2014 her astonishment mountingall the while as he went on speaking, \u2014 events of her life thatwere, says she, unknown even to her nearest friends, andunfolded her secret problems and anxieties. She really thoughtsomebody had told the Swami about her past life and she atlast blurted out, \u201cHow do you know all this? Who has talked ofme to you?\u201dLooking at her with a quiet smile as though she \u201cwere achild who had asked a foolish question,\u201d Swamiji said gently,\u201cNo one has talked to me. Do you think that it is necessary? Iread in you as in an open book.\u201d Swamiji asked her to forget,to become gay and happy again, to build up her health and,above all, not to dwell in silence on her sorrows. \u201cTransmuteyour emotions into some form of external expression. Yourspiritual health requires it. Your art demands it,\u201d were his finalwords of advice. The effect was, as we learn from Mme. Calvealmost instantaneous; Swamiji seemed to have emptied herbrain of its feverish complexities and placed there instead hisown clear and calming thought. She became once morevivacious and cheerful and lived her old life again, with thedifference that it was purged of its impurities and that she couldnow concentrate on her art. Later, it seems, Swamiji initiatedher in some yogic practices \u2014 `a sort of respiratory prayer\u2019 asshe calls them and instilled into her mind the principles ofVedanta. In November 1899, when Swamiji was in America,SWAMIJI AND MADAM CALVESWAMI VIVEKANANDA702Mme. Calve met him at Chicago. In a letter to Mrs. Leggett on30 November 1899 from Chicago, Swamiji wrote, \u201cNothingnew \u2014 except Madam Calve\u2019s visit. She is a great woman. Itis a grand sight to see a giant pine struggling against a cyclone.Is it not?\u201d22. In her company, as we shall see later, Swamijivisited some East European and Middle Eastern countries in1900. On the death of her father, Swamiji wrote her a feelingletter of condolence on 15 May 1902. A few years later shecame to India on a visit, met Swamiji\u2019s mother in Calcutta,and went to Belur with her. We have it from MahendranathDatta that, seated in the Chapel there, she sang some songs,Swamiji\u2019s cousin, Amulya Chandra Datta (Habu Babu), keepingthe tune on esraj23 She lectured on singing in the U.S.A. in1927. Her death was announced at the Vatican on 6 January1942.(Yet another story is told about the influence that Swamijiexercised on persons who came in contact with him \u2014 theobject this time being John Davison Rockefeller (1839-1937).It is related in the Journal of Mme. Verdier from notes takenduring conversations with Mme. Calve but is, unfortunately,otherwise unauthenticated. Beginning his life in 1855 as anassistant bookkeeper on $ 25 a month, Rockefeller (to whosewealth and philanthropy we have already referred above)entered the \u201coil refining\u201d business, had a phenomenal successin it,  and then organized and become the president of theStandard Oil Company, which monopolized almost the entireoil industry in the country. Before he retired from active lifeand handed over his business to his only son, John DavisonRockefeller II (1874-1960), in 1911, he had become thewealthiest man in America, and perhaps the wealthiest inmodern history, amassing as we have said above, a fortuneestimated to be worth a little more than fifteen thousand million703dollars. His methods of doing business, an important featureof which was the creation of the so-called \u201ctrusts\u201d, which werelater declared to be against the law, were quite oftenunscrupulous. But he made history by beginning to spend awayhis vast fortune in philanthropic undertakings on anunprecedented scale and for the promotion of the welfare ofmankind throughout the world. In this he was followed by hisson, who vastly extended the philanthropic activities knownas the Rockefeller Benefactions.As Rockefeller had begun to organize his system ofphilanthropic giving as early as 1890, i.e., before he metSwamiji, the latter\u2019s influence on him could not be regarded asbeing of the same kind as on some others, say Mme. Calve.But, if the story is true \u2014 there is nothing in the facts that havebeen related which is inherently improbable \u2014 the contactbetween the two men, though brief, was for the good of theworld. We state here the facts24, leaving it to the reader to drawhis own conclusions therefrom. At this time Swamiji was livingat the house in Chicago of one of Mr. Rockefeller\u2019s partners,who requested him many times to meet Swamiji. He alwaysrefused to do so but one day, on an impulse, he went to thehouse, brushed aside the butler who opened the door, andunannounced entered into Swamiji\u2019s room. He was muchsurprised to see Swamiji behind his writing table not even liftinghis eyes to see who had entered. However after a time, as withCalve, Swamiji  told Rockefeller about much of his past lifethat was unknown to anyone but himself and made himunderstand that \u201che was only a channel and that his duty wasto do good to the world \u2014 that God had given him all hiswealth in order that he might have an opportunity to help anddo good to people\u201d.SWAMIJI AND ROCK FELLERSWAMI VIVEKANANDA704Rockefeller\u2019s first reaction to Swamiji\u2019s behaviour andwords was one of annoyance. It was impertinent, thought he,for a young monk to give him, Rockefeller, advice and he leftthe room in a huff, without even saying goodbye. But about aweek later he returned and, again entering his roomunannounced, threw upon his desk a paper which told of hisplan to donate an enormous sum of money toward the financingof a public institution, \u201cWell, there you are,\u201d he said. \u201cYoumust be satisfied now and you can thank me for it\u201d. Swamijidid not even lift his eyes, did not move but, taking up the paper,quietly read it and said, \u201cIt is for you to thank me\u201d. Mme Calveremarks that this was Rockefeller\u2019s first large donation to thepublic welfare, which may be quite correct, though, as we havestated above, already in 1890 (before he met Swamiji) he hadstarted on his philanthropic career. The words that Swamiji isreported to have said in this story accord with sentiments thathe often expressed in many places. In his lectures on the KarmaYoga, for example, he said, under the caption, \u201cWe HelpOurselves, Not the World\u201d, \u201cThe only help is that we get moralexercise. . . . Do not stand on a high pedestal and say, `Here,my poor man,\u2019 but be grateful that the poor man is there so thatby making a gift to him you are able to help yourself. It is notthe receiver that is blessed but it is the giver\u201d.25 In almost similarwords, Rockefeller later spoke of his philanthropies as follows,\u201cThere is more to life than the accumulation of money. Moneyis only a trust in one\u2019s hands. To use it improperly is a greatsin. The  best way to prepare for the end of life is to live forothers. That is what I am trying to do\u201d.26IVWe have stated above that, after the Parliament had ended,Swami Vivekananda did not return to his native land, as did705most other delegates, but that he decided to stay on \u2014 his planbeing, as he wrote to Alasinga on 2 November 1893, to spendat least the winter months there and then to proceed to Europe.Shortly afterwards \u2014 perhaps towards the middle, or end ofNovember \u2014 he entered into a contract with a Lecture Bureauengaging himself for a period of three years to deliver lectures,as arranged by them, in America. These facts have raised certaincontroversies concerning the purpose of his coming to Americaand the nature of his mission in the West. In his letters andtalks with some representatives of the press, there are constantreferences to some project which he had in his mind for bringingabout the regeneration of his people and his desire to collect afund in America for the purpose. Indeed, he said on manyoccasions that he had come to America with the chief, if notthe sole, object of interesting Americans in his project so as tobe able to raise a fund for carrying it out after returning toIndia. Some writers have expressed the view that this was reallywhy he came to America \u2014 a rather distressing thought forthousands of Swamiji\u2019s admirers who would still cling to theidea that there was a higher Divine Purpose behind the Westernmission of Swami Vivekananda.The matter deserves careful consideration. As regardsthe project Swamiji had formed for the regeneration of hiscountrymen, we shall have an occasion to deal with it morefully when we come to describe Swamiji\u2019s work in India. Forour present purpose it may suffice to say that we find it outlinedin some letters that he wrote to his gurubhais (specially hisfirst letter to a gurubhai from America, viz., to SwamiRamakrishnananda), in some of his letters to his Madrasidisciples and in his letters to the Maharaja of Khetri and theMaharaja of Mysore. He spoke about the project to somecorrespondents of American newspapers but they do not alwaysTHE PURPOSE OF THE VISIT TO THE WESTSWAMI VIVEKANANDA706seem to have grasped its true nature and different versions of itwere given by them to Americans. At some of the lectures thathe delivered in the days before the Parliament (at Annisquam,Saratoga, etc.) and some public lectures that he delivered atChicago during the sessions of the Parliament, it seems that itwas announced that the speaker had a project for his sufferingcountrymen and that voluntary contributions in its aid werewelcome. But, though we learn from Cornelia Conger thatSwamiji did receive some money at some of the meetings atChicago, his earnings were not anything like what he hadexpected. In a speech at the Parliament on 20 September 1893,he said, rather bitterly, \u201cI came here to seek aid for myimpoverished people, and I fully realized how difficult it wasto get help for the heathens in a Christian land\u201d.Americans could not be greatly blamed if they did notrush in with subscriptions for helping heathens in far-off India,about whom they had many wrong notions. Even in India, aswe have seen, Swamiji had failed to interest many people indonating money for a good cause, eg., for the construction of amemorial for Sri Ramakrishna. However, at one time Swamijiseems seriously to have thought of raising a fund for his projectin India with voluntary subscriptions from the American people,and /or earning money \u201cby the force of his brain,\u201d an idea thatas a monk he abhorred. As we know from his letter to Alasingareferred to above, he had learned that lecturing was a profitableoccupation in America \u2014 two of his own countrymen, MissSorabji  of Poona, and Mr. Virchand Gandhi, the Jainrepresentative at the Parliament, having already begun to doso. He did not divulge his own plan yet to Alasinga but we mayinfer that he had received the cue and we know that he hadalready embarked upon his career as a \u201ccyclonic\u201d lecturer.Earlier, in a letter to Mrs. Tannatt Woods dated 26 October he707had told her that he was going on very well, having hadengagements every week and also earning pretty well. In aletter to Prof. Wright written on the same day (26 October 1893)he informed him about his change of plan. \u201cThe heathen drawsmore than his project,\u201d wrote he \u201cSo I want to go to workearnestly for my own project only keeping the project in thebackground and working like any other lecturer\u201d.27In accordance with this new plan Swamiji left Chicagoon 20 November 1893 for Madison (Wisconsin) andMinneapolis (Minnesota), as we learn from a letter he wrote toMrs. Woods on 19 November28. As recent researches haverevealed, his programme also included delivering of lecturesat Des Moines (Iowa) and Memphis (Tennesse). It is likelythat he visited also other cities in the Midwest (the CentralBasin) and the South (the region of the Southeast), but we haveno precise information concerning them. It is now known thatthe whole (or nearly the whole) of this tour of Swamiji hadbeen arranged by a lecture bureau, with which he had, as wehave stated above, entered into a three-year contract. The actualname of this lecture bureau is not ascertained yet. SisterChristine name it as Pond\u2019s Lecture Bureau, but the AppealAvalanche of Memphis which, in its issue of January, 1893,gave out the information that Swamiji was at this time under athree-year contract with a lecture bureau, named it the SlaytonLyceum Bureau of Chicago. Perhaps Pond\u2019s was only anothername of the Slayton Lyceum, but the exact name is important,for once this is established, further enquiries may befacilitated.29The exact date on which Swamiji entered into thiscontract is not known, but since there is no mention of it in hisletter to Alasinga of 2 November 1893 (in which, however, asTHE PURPOSE OF THE VISIT TO THE WESTSWAMI VIVEKANANDA708we have seen, he says that lecturing is a profitable occupationin America, etc.), it may have been under contemplation atthis time and, perhaps, was actualized shortly afterwards, sayby the middle, or end of November. In his letter Swamiji saysthat he would stay on in America \u201cat least through the winter\u201dfrom which one could infer that the stay might be longer butnot that he would contract to stay in the country for as long asthree years. Why did he enlist himself under a lecture bureauand why, further, did he do so for such a long period as threeyears? What, after all, were the real objects of his staying on inthe West? The answer to the first question is rather obvious; itwas a logical development of his decision to go on a lecturetour in the manner of Miss Sorabji and Mr. Gandhi. As Mrs.Burke says, such things as lecture bureaus, concert agencies,etc., were more or less \u201cnecessary evils\u201d, then as now, to thoselike Swamiji who wanted to come before the general Americanpublic, there being no other way to make coordinatedarrangements in many towns. Secondly, as Martha BrowneFincke has stated, Swamiji wanted to be \u201cindependent of thepersonal benefactions of his admirers\u201d.30 (Mrs. Fincke hadknown Swamiji when as a student in the Smith\u2019s College,Northampton, Mass., she resided at a boardinghouse in theCollege campus and Swamiji, who had come to the place tocarry out a lecture programme, was also lodged there, April,1894.) Though Swamiji, as we know from his letters to Prof.Wright and Mrs. Woods, has begun to earn something, hisincome was neither stable nor sufficient and, however muchhis friends wanted that he should stay with  them, he did notlike to be a perpetual dependent, and hotels were veryexpensive.Then there was his desire to lay by a little fund which hemight utilize for starting some institutions when he returned to709India, and also, as Miss S.E. Waldo (Sister Haridasi) says,31 \u201ctosend help to his fellow Sannyasins in India\u201d. These explainwhy Swamiji made a contract with a lecture bureau but notwhy it was for such a long period as three years. Surely Swamijihad become convinced that he would have to stay in Americafor a long time \u2014 it could not be that he made a three-yearcontract with a mental reservation (to get out of it earlier ifnecessary). He certainly had decided to stay in America for along time and, if he had so decided, it was for a very importantpurpose that he had done so \u2014 something more than earningmoney for his project. That object could be and as it seems tous was none other than the fulfillment of his mission in life,the work that Sri Ramakrishna had said the Divine Mother hadwilled that he should do. It was, to use his own words, \u201cthework to do\u201d that, when lying at death\u2019s door he had more thanonce told his gurubhais he could not leave unperformed beforehe left his body \u2014 in short, the purpose for which he believedthe Divine Mother had shown him the way to America. Hetold his gurubhais, Swamis Brahmananda and Turiyananda,when they happened to meet each other at Abu Road Station,that the Parliament of Religions was willed by God to preparefor his success. As we have said above he had some otherobjects, such as to be independent of his \u201cpatrons\u201d (whosometimes took up the role for considerations of their own), orto get up a fund for work in India or, much more importantly,to disabuse American minds of their misconceptions of Indians.But the main reason was his mission. As Sister Christine hassaid, \u201cThe impulse which was urging him on and which wasnever entirely  absent from his mind was the mission with whichhis Master had entrusted him. He had a work to do, a messageto give. It was a sacred message. How was he to give it?\u201d32 Hesoon found that even the lecture tour that he had decided uponat this time \u201cwas not the way\u201d and, as we have said above, heTHE PURPOSE OF THE VISIT TO THE WESTSWAMI VIVEKANANDA710changed his method, but the Purpose remained fixed in hismind.At the very beginning of this section we have referred tothe fact that there are some controversies concerning the ideathat Swamiji had in his mind about the purpose of his comingto America and even concerning the nature of his mission inthe West. Mrs. Burke has taken careful note of theinterpretations that have been given on these subjects and findsthat they are mainly threefold. They are that he wanted \u2014 (1)to teach Vedanta to the West; (2) to raise funds for thedevelopment of his Indian work and, incidentally to providefor his own support during his stay in America; and (3) to givethe American people a correct idea of Hinduism, to removecurrent misconceptions regarding his motherland and toinculcate a spirit of religious tolerance. Mrs. Burke\u2019s own viewis that it was not till the last of 1894 that the idea of teachingVedanta to the West fully evolved in Swamiji\u2019s mind, and thatprior to this \u201cthe uppermost outward motives\u201d33, or \u201capparentmotives\u201d that had guided him were (2) and (3) as listed above.As these two latter motives are not \u201ccommensurate with hisspiritual nature\u201d, he has, says she, been \u201cforced . . . to recognizethat his tour had another and more fundamental meaning\u201d, andthat \u201cduring his travels he was, consciously or unconsciously,fulfilling the function of a divine prophet to America\u201d34. Inanother context, she has observed as follows: \u201cHe came withthe purpose of getting help for India, of telling the Americanpeople of his country\u2019s real needs and real genius, but he stayedonly to give, pouring  himself out for the sake of Americans,for he could not see hunger in any form, spiritual or physical,without filling it\u201d.35711Mrs. Burke recognizes that \u201cSwamiji\u2019s matureconception of his mission\u201d was implicit in his earlier activities,that \u201cinevitably he taught some Vedanta in all his lectures \u2014whether under that name or not \u2014 Vedanta being a part of hisvery nature\u201d. But, says she, if one reads the concepts of 1895into those of 1893 and 1894, one runs into complications. Thereare, says she, in support of her statements, firstly, the lettersthat Swamiji wrote during the first nine or ten months of hisstay in America, particularly the letters he wrote to Alasingaon 20 August 1893, and to Swami Ramakrishnananda in March,1894 (the exact date of the letter being subject to a controversy)that contain categorical statements that he came to America\u201cto earn money\u201d. (Mrs. Burke also mentions a letter thatSwamiji wrote in April, 1897 to Sarala Devi, which in heropinion, proves that even as late as that he was expectingAmerican aid for India.) The second fact that, according toMrs. Burke, raises difficulties is Swamiji\u2019s own statements thathe did not care for the Parliament, which was, as quoted by usalready once above, \u201conly something by the way . . . only anopening, an opportunity\u201d. Many more statements of a likenature in letters, lectures, and interviews to pressmen may bequoted, and some have been also quoted by us in the precedingpages, including his statement in the Parliament on 20September 1893, \u201cI came here to seek aid for my impoverishedpeople. . . .\u201dWithout doubt Swamiji expected to be able to receivesome material help for his impoverished countrymen fromAmericans, but to conclude that he came to their country witha view to earning money for that purpose and that during thefirst nine or ten months his activities were directed solely (oreven mainly) to that end also lands one in difficulties. If onewants to rely only on his letters and statements to establish oneTHE PURPOSE OF THE VISIT TO THE WESTSWAMI VIVEKANANDA712view, one discovers in them disconcerting evidences whichsupport also other \u2014 and even apparently contradictory \u2014views. Mrs. Burke herself quotes the following words inSwamiji\u2019s letter to Haripada Mitra dated 28 December 1893,\u201cWe will teach them (Americans) our spirituality, and assimilatewhat is best in their society\u201d. But she dismisses the statementas an evidence that is relevant to the discussion on the groundthat for many months again we do not read of this idea andthat, although the thought may have occurred to Swamiji fromtime to time, it had not taken deep root in his mind. It may bepointed out, however, that only about a month later, 21 January1894, the idea occurs in what he told the reporter of the AppealAvalanche of Memphis36: \u201cBy uniting the materialism of theWest with the spiritualism of the East I believe much can beaccomplished\u201d. The idea is still more clearly expressed evenin his first letter from America to gurubhai, viz., his letter toSwami Ramakrishnananda. He says there, \u201cI give themspirituality, and they give me money\u201d.37 In a letter to Alasinga,written in the same year (exact date not known) he wrote,\u201cEvery nation must save itself, we must not depend upon fundsfrom America for the revival of Hinduism, for that is a delusion.Try to have the sympathies of the Maharaja of Mysore, theRaja of Khetri, and some others for this work\u201d.38 On the otherhand, he wrote to Swami Sivananda (year 1894, exact date notknown), \u201cI would have, before this, returned to India, but Indiahas no money. Thousands honour Ramakrishna Paramahamsa-deva, but nobody will pay a price \u2014 that is India. Here peoplehave money, and they pay\u201d.39 In the same strain, but moreemphatically, he wrote to Swami Brahmananda (year 1894,date not known). \u201cTell the great man who writes to me to finishmy preaching and return home that I am not the man to lickanybody\u2019s boots like a dog. Tell him also that if he is a man, lethim first set up one Math, and then call me. Otherwise, to whom713shall I return? This country is more my home \u2014 what is therein Hindusthan? Who appreciates religion? Who appreciateslearning? To return home! Where is the home?\u201d40 He, however,wrote to Alasinga (year 1894, date not known) that he haddecided to return to India in the coming summer. \u201cMoney\u201d,wrote he, \u201ccan be raised in this country by lecturing for two orthree years. I have tried a little, and although there is muchpublic appreciation of my work, it is thoroughly uncongenialand demoralizing to me\u201d.41 He wrote to Mrs. Ole Bull on 14February 1895, \u201cAccording to Manu, collecting funds even fora good work is not good for a Sannyasin, and I have begun tofeel that the old sages were right\u201d.42The idea of raising money in America in aid of hisimpoverished countrymen certainly predominates in Swamiji\u2019sletters and statements of this period. But there are otherevidences concerning the object of his mission which we musttake into account and which point to different conclusion. Evensome statements which he made when he was in America andduring the very period, viz., till the fall of 1894, when, accordingto Mrs. Burke, \u201cthe uppermost outward motives\u201d or \u201capparentmotives\u201d that guided him, were other than teaching Vedanta,prove that he had a different conception of the work that hewas doing then. In a letter written to a disciple, Gobinda Sahay,in 1894 (exact date not known), Swamiji wrote as follows:\u201cPerhaps you have learned that I have been preaching Hindureligion in India. I am doing very well here\u201d.43 Everyone inIndia who had heard that he had appeared in the Parliament ofReligions in America and was going about lecturing in thatcountry believed that it was as a delegate of the Hindu religionthat he had gone to America and also that it was preachingHinduism that had detained him there. A remarkable statementthat he made in a  letter to a Madrasi disciple in the dark monthTHE PURPOSE OF THE VISIT TO THE WESTSWAMI VIVEKANANDA714of June 1894, when he believed that the Americans hadwithdrawn their helping hand from him and that, as he thought,his Indian friends would not lift their little finger to help him,shows the real purpose of his stay in America and hisdetermination to carry it out, whatever be the odds against him.In this letter, dated 28 June 1894, he declared in unmistakableterms as follows, \u201cAmerica is the best field in the world tocarry on any idea; so I do not think of leaving America soon. .. . I have launched my boat in the waves, come what may\u201d.44What then about his statement disparaging the Parliament ofReligions and disavowing that he came to America to attendit? We are definitely of opinion that a wrong construction isput upon it if it is made to imply that he came to America notto attend the Parliament of Religions, and that his purpose indoing so was to earn money for his people in that country. Hedoes not say so here and, as we shall see presently, emphasizedthe spiritual purpose of his mission in many statements that hemade after returning to India. In our opinion, this particularstatement only means that he thought that there were also othermethods by which he could carry on his mission. Prof. Wright,as we know, made him realize the importance of the Parliament.To those who had sent him to America, he may not havecommitted himself to act as the delegate of Hinduism at theParliament of Religions and, as he wrote of Prof. Wright, theyhad left him free in the matter. But two things are clear. Firstly,after he had gone through intensive sadhanas and travelled farand wide during the years of his monastic wanderings he hadbecome conscious that he had a message to deliver. Secondly,many people who came to know him during those days formedthe opinion that he was a man with a message and that he mustgo to America to deliver it. In Chapter 6 above, we have statedmany facts that bear out both these propositions. To recount715only a few of them here, on his way from Nainital to Almora,he had a wonderful realization of truths as he sat in meditationunder a banian tree. They were a host of ideas which he jotteddown in a notebook and which, as it were, lodged themselvesin his brain and demanded delivery to humanity at large. Hetold Swami Trigunatita at Porbandar that such power hadaccumulated within him that he felt that he could revolutionizethe world. The ruler of Cutch, who confessed that his brain gotdizzy when he listened to his talks, told him, \u201cYou will neverrest until you have done wonderful things\u201d. And the scholarpolitician, Pandit Pandurang who, on account of his recent toursin Europe, had understood the spiritual requirements of theWestern world and understood him also thoroughly, franklyadvised him to go to the West. The Raja of Khetri expressedhis approval of Swamiji\u2019s going to the West as soon as he gotthe news that he had intended to do so. In a letter to MunshiJagmohanlal, dated 11 April 1893, he wrote, \u201cI heartily agreewith Swamiji\u2019s views about going to Europe where he has sucha grand point to aim at. I should never be so selfish, but wouldbe rather contented and happy if the world could derive anybenefit from one whom I am fortunate and proud to call myGuroo\u201d.45If thus, before he left for America, the purpose of hisgoing to the West was clearly known to everybody about himand he himself had a clear idea on the subject, all people inIndia who watched with interest his activities and movementsin America during his long stay there rejoiced at the successeshe achieved there for the cause he and they had at their hearts.When he returned to India, as we shall see in Chapter 12 below,he was given a hero\u2019s welcome for having fulfilled his missionand he acknowledged the appreciation of his countrymen withwords of becoming modesty and submission to the will of God.THE PURPOSE OF THE VISIT TO THE WESTSWAMI VIVEKANANDA716In a speech delivered at Victoria Hall, Madras, he franklytold his listeners, among whom there must have been presentthe young men who had sent him to America, that his going toAmerica was neither his nor their doing. \u201cBut\u201d, said he, \u201ctheGod of India who is guiding her destiny sent me, and will sendhundreds of such to all nations of the world\u201d.46 In a speech atthe Triplicane Literary Society delivered a few days later heexplained the point more fully: \u201cWe find India again reviving,and ready to give her own quota to the progress and civilizationof the world. And that I have been forced, as it were, by natureto go over and preach to America and England is the result\u201d.47In another lecture at Madras, entitled The Future of India, hesaid, \u201cI will lay before you my ideas. They have been in mymind for a long time, even years before I left the shores ofMadras for America, and that I went to America and Englandwas simply for propagating those ideas\u201d (stress added).48No doubt, on the eve of his departure for the West, as hesat at Kanyakumari on the last bit of Indian rock, sleeplessly inmeditation, Mother India with her teeming and impoverishedmillions appeared before his vision, reminding him about thewords of his Master: \u201cAn empty stomach is no good forreligion\u201d. As he wrote to Swami Ramakrishnananda in his firstletter to a gurubhai from America, thereupon he hit upon aplan for the regeneration of India \u2014 the raising of the masses,as he called it. He said that he needed men and money toimplement it and that because the latter could not be had inIndia, he had come to America.49 The thought of the sufferingmillions of India, as the reader is aware, had been always withhim, long before he sat in meditation before the Virgin Goddesson the last bit of Indian rock. As the result of his sadhanas, aswe have stated in an earlier chapter, his mind had soared tosupernal heights but his heart had also expanded, keeping itpinned to the earth. It was but natural that when he thought of717giving to the world the truth of Vedanta, he was painfullyreminded of the physical needs of mankind, specially of hiscountrymen, reduced to the condition of brutes by foreignsubjection and appalling poverty. If, simultaneously withcarrying on his spiritual mission in America, he could earn alittle money that could help him in his work in India, it couldnot be wondered at that he should attempt to do it. He found itdemoralizing, as we have said above, and after he had obtainedhis release from the Lecture Bureau, seems to have given uplecturing for money. As regards his statements, which weremany during the early years of his stay in America, that he hadcome to America to earn some money in aid of some projecthe had in mind for his countrymen, Swami Gambhiranandaonce cautioned as follows: \u201cTo be sure, he often hinted at thefinancial object of his visit. . . . But one should notoveremphasize these aspects of his life\u201d.50 It seems to us thatSwamiji rather emphasized them \u2014 and friendly Americanreporters often referred to his \u201cproject\u201d \u2014 with a view tocounteracting, so far as possible, the propaganda that he wantedto convert Americans to Hinduism and had actually convertedsome in Chicago (see Section VII below).51 Later still, in 1899,when he came on a visit to America, one of his avowed objectswas to earn money, but the circumstances then were different,and it may not be safe to conclude that in 1893 he acted withmotives which he had in his mind in 1899 (or even in 1897, asexpressed in his letter to Sarala Devi).If Swamiji sometimes made conflicting statements, shallwe conclude that he was inconsistent? To some of his disciples,especially those who heard him talk frequently, he did appearto be so. Sister Christine\u2019s observations on the subject arehelpful. \u201cIt often seemed to us\u201d, says she, \u201cthat SwamiVivekananda was not consistent. . . . As Emerson says, `ATHE PURPOSE OF THE VISIT TO THE WESTSWAMI VIVEKANANDA718foolish consistence  is the hobgoblin of little minds\u2019. He waslooking at all the problems of life from a different vantagepoint. ... The most he ever said, was, `Don\u2019t you see I wasthinking aloud?\u2019\u201d52. Is it possible that, on the subject of goingto the West, he was thinking from a number of vantage points?Were what he said apparently differently in different times reallyinconsistent with each other? It seems to us that, if instead offixing our attention on his statements and activities in 1893-1895, we turn it backwards and forwards, a single, consistentpurpose is found to run through them. It was borne in uponhim, pretty early in his life that the ordinary way of the worldwas not his to tread, at Dakshineswar that it was the will of theDivine Mother that he should work out a purpose of Hers, andin short that he was to wander on the surface of the globe as ateacher unto mankind. Whatever one may think of that, hehimself thought so, or came to think so, and he prepared himselffor this role of life by the hardest sadhanas, studies andwanderings. To construe the purpose of his Western visitotherwise, simply because he was found to make certainstatements at certain times of this visit, is to ignore the wholehistory of the Ramakrishna Narendranath relationship and ofthe slow but logical stages through which Narendranath passedand emerged as Swami Vivekananda. It would be to ignorealso the fact that after he returned to India he did not settledown to material development work in India but to waken hiscountrymen to the truths of their being (to the divine in man)which, being realized, proclaimed he, makes the realization ofall material goals possible. Not nation making, but man making,said he, was his aim. (In later days, indeed, he has been chargedwith \u201cputting the cart of spiritualism before the horse offreedom\u201d.53) In fine, to emphasize the monetary aspect of hiswork in the West is to shut one\u2019s eyes to his past history and torefuse to follow his career in his future work.719Even admitting that to earn a little money for his futurework in India was one his objects in going to America, one hasto recognize that he did not go out to seek \u201cAmerican aid\u201d inthe manner of the leaders of developing nations today. (It issurprising that Mrs. Burke has referred in this connection to\u201cSwamiji\u2019s dream of substantial material help to India\u201d as\u201cbeginning to come true\u201d some sixty years after he had dreamtabout it. One must repudiate the idea that Swamiji went with abegging bowl in his hand, seeking for \u201caid\u201d from developednations, who invariably have some visible or invisible stringsattached to what they give \u2014 principally in the interests oftheir own national policy. He gave for all that he received \u2014his gift being from the casket of the gems of Indian spiritualitythat he always carried with him. He expected thereby to gainfor his people the respect of the great peoples of the West who,he believed, would thus be induced to give his peopleknowledge of Western science and technology. This process of\u201cgive and take\u201d, thought he, had to be commenced urgentlyand in the interests of both. He felt that the Western world wason the brink of a precipice, and might go to pieces tomorrow;it was on a volcano which might burst tomorrow.54 He saidthat the revival of national life in India required that Indianthought must conquer the world, and that \u201cwe must do it or diein the very interests of our national life, our awakened vigorousnational life\u201d.VIn a letter to Mrs. Tannatt Woods, dated 19 November 1893,Swami Vivekananda said that he was leaving for Madison andMinneapolis on the following day.55 Though he did not tell heranything about what this indicated, we now know that he hadadopted a programme of work, according to which he was toTHE PURPOSE OF THE VISIT TO THE WESTSWAMI VIVEKANANDA720embark on a lecture tour of the Midwest and the South whichwas to last until 25 March 1894. We shall presently give anaccount of his activities during this period, that is, from 20November 1893 when he left Chicago for Madison till 25 March1894, when he returned from Memphis to Chicago for a threeweeks\u2019 much needed rest. But before we proceed to do so, weshall give our readers, some of whom may be unfamiliar witheven the names of the cities and States that Swamiji visited, alittle information concerning them.Starting from Chicago on 20 November, Swamiji wason a continuous tour till he reached Des Moines on 27November. Within a little more than a week, he had visitedthree States of the Midwest (the Central Basin), viz., Wisconsin,Minnesota, and Iowa, covered a distance of 677 miles by rail(Chicago to Minneapolis - 417 miles, Minneapolis to DesMoines - 260 miles), and delivered lectures at three cities(Madison, Minneapolis and Des Moines). Hundreds of peoplemet him at these places and many asked questions to which hegave replies with unfailing courtesy and impressing everybodyby his prodigious scholarship. The State of Wisconsin lies justto the north of Illinois and extends in the north to the southernshore of Lake Superior which separates it from Canada. TheState of Minnesota, whose northern boundary runs along partof the southern boundary of Canada, lies to the west ofWisconsin. The State of Iowa lies just to the south of Minnesotaand to the west of Wisconsin and Illinois. Wisconsin is famousfor its great dairy products (in 1956 ranking first in milkproduction with 16\u00bd billion lbs.) and its capital city, Madison,named after James Madison, the fourth American President, isa great educational centre. Minnesota, which is known as \u201ctheland of 10,000 lakes\u201d, is rich both in agriculture and industriesand is famous for its contribution to surgery and medicine, the721Mayo Clinic at Rochester being world famous. Minneapolis,the largest city of the State, contains  the main campus of theUniversity of Minnesota. Iowa is the heartland of Americanagriculture and possesses some of the finest soil in the world.It leads the nation in literacy (the percentage being 99.2), andis also one of the leaders in corn. It has a number of famouseducational institutions, including Iowa University, and DrakeUniversity - the latter being located at Des Moines, the capitalcity. About Memphis, we shall say something later.Swamiji arrived at Madison on 20 November anddelivered a lecture in the evening of the same day at theCongregational Church. The subject of the lecture was possiblyHindu religion, on which he spoke also at Minneapolis andDes Moines. The Wisconsin State Journal, which published abrief report of the lecture on 21 November, spoke highly aboutit and the lecturer. The two lectures that he delivered atMinneapolis, where he arrived on 24 November at the invitationof the local Peripatetic Club, were better reported. Theyreceived equally high praise in the local journals. Both weredelivered at the First Unitarian Church and on the secondoccasion, the pastor Dr. H.M. Simmons, led with readings fromSt. Paul\u2019s lesson on faith, supplementing them with readingsfrom the Hindu and Islamic scriptures and poems from Hinduliterature, all of which were in harmony with Paul\u2019s teachings.Swamiji began his lecture with a recital of a story of five blindmen that, by the way, Sri Ramakrishna used frequently tonarrate, who, taken to an elephant, imbibed their ideas of it bytouching its body. They then quarreled with each other as towhat was the exact form of the beast, one maintaining that itwas like a wall, another that it was like a rope, a third that itwas like a serpent, a fourth that it was like a pillow, and thelast on that all the others were wrong, and that it was like a fan.LECTURE TOUR IN THE MID-WEST AND THE SOUTHSWAMI VIVEKANANDA722A passerby, who found them fighting with each other, enquiredwhat the quarrel was about and being  explained about it said,\u201cMen, you are all right: the trouble is you touched the elephantat different points. The wall is the side, the rope the tail, thetrunk the serpent, the pillow the toes and the fan the ear. Stopyour quarrelling: you are all right, only you have been viewingthe elephant from different standpoints\u201d. Then Swamiji said,\u201cReligion has become involved in such a quarrel. The peopleof the West thought they had the only religion of God and thepeople of the East held the same prejudice. Both were wrong;God was in every religion\u201d.After he had thus indicated his own wide catholicity ofviews and the necessity for a universal outlook on religion, hewas listened to with patience and respect when he criticizedChristians for having a \u201cshop keeping religion\u201d. Illustratingthe point, he said that Christians were constantly begging ofGod for favours, thinking of Him only when they got along allright and forgetting Him as soon as they had a reverse. He thensaid that they had palaces for worship of God, which theyattended in part for a time once a week \u2014 very few going thereto worship God. Swamiji seems to have ended this lecture witha reference to the activities of the Christian missionaries inIndia. The people both in the East and the West, he said, mustlearn to \u201cwant\u201d God, and this \u201cwant\u201d he compared to the manunder water, struggling for air; he wanted it, he could not livewithout it. Here again Swamiji may have narrated SriRamakrishna\u2019s story of a guru and his disciple. The guru, beingasked by his disciple how he could have God, took him to apond, forcibly held him in the water when he attempted tohave a dip in it. The latter, facing death from suffocation, usedall the strength of his body to get above the water, and at lastsucceeded in doing so. The guru then told the disciple that he723could have God if he wanted Him as he had wanted to livewhen he was struggling to come up from the water. Swamijisaid that when the people of the West \u201cwanted\u201d God in thatmanner, they would be welcome in India, because then themissionaries would come with God, not with the idea that Indiaknows not God but with love in their hearts and not dogma.Without taking even a day\u2019s rest, Swamiji travelled toDes Moines (250 miles from Minneapolis) and reaching it inthe afternoon of 27 November 1893 at once met some of theintellectual elite of the city, who had been invited by Dr. H.O.Breedon, a leading citizen, for a talk with him at his residence.After he had given an informal talk there on the manners andcustoms of India, he was subjected to a running fire of questionsfrom the guests, his witty and often sarcastic replies provinghighly entertaining. From what we learn about his experiencesat other similar meetings later, we may suppose that here too,he was asked such delectable questions as whether Indianmothers threw their babies into the waters of the Ganga to bedevoured by crocodiles, and/or, if they did so, why they threwonly female babies to the beasts. We may feel sure that, if thesequestions were asked, his replies had been as follows. To besure, his mother had thrown him to the crocodiles. The beasts,however, finding him to be a fat baby with strong bones,recognized the risk to their teeth if they attempted to masticatehim, and so spared him. To another lady questioner, who hadput him the question, he had replied, \u201cYes, Madam! They threwme in, but like your fabled Jonah, I got out again\u201d.56 As regardsthe question why Indian mothers gave only female children tothe crocodiles, he must have replied ironically that that wasbecause they were softer and more tender and could be moreeasily masticated by the crocodiles.57 Literally from thisreception at Dr. Breeden\u2019s house, Swamiji went to the CentralLECTURE TOUR IN THE MID-WEST AND THE SOUTHSWAMI VIVEKANANDA724Church of Christ, where he was due to deliver a lecture on theHindu Religion that had been announced at short notice in thepress.Swami Vivekananda delivered two lectures at DesMoines, the first being on \u201cThe Hindu Religion\u201d at the CentralChurch of Christ on 27 November, as we have said above, andthe second at the same place on the following evening on\u201cReincarnation\u201d. The second lecture was not reported and thefirst done only briefly and it is obvious from the account giventhat the reporter \u201cwoefully failed\u201d to follow Swamiji\u2019sarguments regarding some of the topics dealt with by him,particularly what he said about conversion. We may take itthat in this lecture Swamiji said very much the same thingsthat he had said in his lecture on the same subject only one dayearlier at Minneapolis. But the reporter of the Des Moines paperdeserves our thanks for having recorded Swamiji\u2019s views onsome subjects which we get in other speeches and writingsalso, but appear to us as specially striking on account of thefelicity of their expression. A few lines from his report are wellworth quoting. \u201cHe holds that one must embrace all the religionsto become the perfect Christian.... When you send a missionaryto our country he becomes a Hindu Christian and I a ChristianHindu. I have often been asked in this country if I am going totry to convert the people here. I take this for an insult. I do notbelieve in this idea of conversion\u201d. (Then the reporter putssome words in Swamiji\u2019s mouth in explanation of his own ideaof conversion which, as we have said above, are misleading.)The concluding portion of the lecture may be quoted herein full. \u201cThere are in our country two words which have analtogether different meaning than they do in this country. Theyare `religion\u2019 and `sect\u2019. We hold that religion embraces all725religions. We tolerate everything but intoleration. Then thereis that word `sect\u2019. Here it embraces those sweet people whowrap themselves up in their mantle of charity and say, `We areright; you are wrong.\u2019 It reminds me of the story of the twofrogs. A frog was born in a well and lived its whole life in thatwell. One day a frog from the sea fell in that well and theycommenced a talk about the sea. The frog whose home was inthe well asked his visitor how large the sea was but was unableto get an intelligible answer. Then the home frog jumped fromone corner of the well to another and asked his visitor if thesea was that large. He said yes. The frog jumped again andsaid, `Is the sea that large?\u2019 and receiving an affirmative answer,he said to himself, `This frog must be a liar; I will put him outof my well\u2019. That is the very way with these sects. They seekto eject and trample those who do not believe as they do\u201d.Swamiji\u2019s movements cannot be traced for about a monthand a half from now, that is, from 28 November 1893, when hedelivered his second lecture at Des Moines till 13 January 1894when we find him at Memphis, Tennessee. According to theIowa State Register, his stay at Des Moines was prolonged bythe cancellation of engagements \u201cfurther west\u201d. Perhaps theseengagements had been only deferred and not cancelled andSwamiji might be visiting, among other Western States, theneighbouring one of Nebraska where, at Omraha58 IsabelleMcKinley\u2019s married sister, Mrs. Mary Baker, lived. A letterfrom Swamiji to Haripada Mitra is dated 28 December 1893 atChicago c/o the Hales\u2019 home there, and it is also probable thatbefore going to Memphis he came to Chicago and stayed for afew days there. Even if we assumed that he did visit someWestern States besides the three we know he visited and thathe stayed for a few days, or weeks at Chicago, a big blank isstill left in our knowledge of his movements and activitiesLECTURE TOUR IN THE MID-WEST AND THE SOUTHSWAMI VIVEKANANDA726during the period which began from his departure from DesMoines and his arrival at Memphis.Before we proceed further with the story of Swamiji\u2019slecture tour, let us pause awhile and discuss the date of a letterwhich he wrote at about this time to Swami Ramakrishnananda,to which we have referred above, and which was the first letterwhich he wrote to a gurubhai after reaching America. The letterwas dated by Swamiji as Chicago, 19 March 1894 butprincipally on the ground that a letter written by SwamiRamakrishnananda to Munshi Jagmohanlal dated 10 February1894 has a mention of a letter received by him from Swamijiand contains a summary of what the latter wrote to him in sucha way that no doubt is left that it was the identical letter thatwas dated by Swamiji as 19 March, it has been contended thatSwamiji was mistaken in the date given by him and that it wasactually written sometime earlier. With regard to SwamiRamakrishnananda\u2019s letter, too, one finds that though the dateis given by Mr. Sharma59 as 10 February 1894, Mrs. Burke,citing his authority, gives it as 18 February 1894 and basingher argument on this date (18 February) argues that Swamiji\u2019sletter was written \u201caround the middle of January\u201d. In reply toan enquiry from the present writer as to how she took the dateto be 18 February whereas in Mr. Sharma\u2019s book it is given as10 February, she has been kind enough to clarify as follows:\u201cThe date I have given to Swami Ramakrishnananda\u2019s letter toMunshi Jagmohanlal in second edition of the `New Discoveries\u2019is, I believe, correct. Before the publication of his book Mr.Sharma very kindly sent me a copy of the typescript. There thedate given to this letter is `The 18th February 1894'. This is thedate given to it in a list of letters that Mr. Sharma sent me. Itwould seem, then, that `The 10th February 1894' in the printedbook (p. 195) is a typographical error. I shall ask Mr. Sharma727about it. I am very glad to have this drawn to my attention, andperhaps something should be said about it in a possible thirdedition of `New Discoveries\u2019.Before a clarification can be obtained from Mr. Sharma,we have no option but to consider the date given in the printedbook which, be it noted, was published after the typescript wassent and, moreover, was the same in the Bengali translation ofthe book which was published still later, that is after the bookin English was published, to be the one correctly given by Mr.Sharma. But a clarification from Mr. Sharma is, after all, notvery necessary since, even if we take it for granted that thecorrect date of Swami Ramakrishnananda\u2019s letter is 18 February1894, certain difficulties arise. Swamiji, then, must have writtenhis letter by 15 January 1894, that is, about one month earlier,one month being the minimum time for a letter from Americato reach Calcutta. (In a letter to Swami Ramakrishnananda in1895 Swamiji said that it took a month and a half for a letterfrom India to reach him in America.)60 Mrs. Burke says that hewrote \u201caround the middle of January\u201d. But we know definitelythat Swamiji was at Memphis on 13 January 1894 and not atChicago where he wrote that letter. We many avoid the difficultyif we think that the letter was written not \u201caround the middleof January\u201d when he was at Memphis but still earlier, say on28 December 1893 when he was at Chicago and when he wrotea letter dated Chicago to Haripada Mitra. But why should wethink that Swamiji made such a glaring mistake61 in dating hisletter as 19 March instead of some date when he was at Chicago,say some date \u201caround the middle of January\u201d, or before 12January, or on 28 December 1893? The fact that the lettercontained a description of the American winter should notpresent a difficulty, for this being the first letter that he wroteto his gurubhai an account of his experiences in the precedingLECTURE TOUR IN THE MID-WEST AND THE SOUTHSWAMI VIVEKANANDA728winter could be expected to be given. On the whole, one maythink, till further evidence on the subject is obtained, the dateof Swamiji\u2019s letter as given by him, viz., 19 March 1894, maynot be rejected outright. It may be pointed out that this issupported by a statement  made by Mahendranath Datta that itwas on a certain Sunday in the summer season that aboutmidday a postal peon delivered two letters addressed to SwamiRamakrishnananda by Swamiji. This was the first time, saysMahendranath, that after a long time a letter was received atthe Math.62Even if this letter were written \u201caround the middle ofJanuary\u201d, or in early January 1894, or on 28 December 1893,or thereabout, it would strike one as strange that this first letterof his to his gurubhais of Calcutta was written not before eightmonths had elapsed since he had left India\u2019s shores on 31 May1893. Of course, for long, after he had left the Baranagore Mathin July, 1890, he had ceased corresponding with them. But thatwas because he wanted to wander about incognito. As we haveseen, sometime before he embarked on the voyage to America,he had ceased to be strict about the secrecy which he wantedto be imposed on his movements. On the voyage to Americaand after reaching that country he wrote to his friends in Indiaa number of times. He wrote at least three letters to his Madrasidisciples (10 July, 20 August, 2 November), a letter to HaripadaMitra (28 December), two letters to the Maharaja of Khetriduring his voyage to America63, and perhaps also sent a cableto Manmathanath Bhattacharya. Why were his gurubhais aloneleft without a word being sent to them? Mrs. Burke suggeststhat the reason was that many of the monks were away, fromCalcutta, but she herself points out that when Swamiji wantedto communicate his plans to his brother monks and wrote toSwami Sivananda asking that he call them back to Calcutta to729begin work (possibly in April of 1894), he found their dispersionover India no particular drawback. Moreover, one may think,if some of the monks were away, Swami Ramakrishnanandawas sure to be at the Math and Swamiji could write to himalways with the assurance that he would do  the needful tobegin the work on the lines suggested by him. In an earlierChapter we have stated that there were quarrels at the Math,for which Swami Abhedananda had to leave it and that Swamijiwas deeply mortified to hear the story from the latter when hemet him at Junagarh. Was Swamiji waiting for these differencesat the Math to be composed before he could ask his brothers towork as a united team for the great work he wanted them tobegin?64Swamiji arrived at Memphis on Saturday, 13 January1894, being invited there by the members of the localNineteenth Century Club, some of whom had attended theParliament of Religions and been so impressed that they wantedhim to come to their city once. Memphis, which is 553 milesfrom Chicago, is the largest city of Tennessee, a State in theSouth Central (southeastern) region of the U.S.A. It has a fineauditorium, with seats for 1250 persons, at which Swamijidelivered a lecture. The city of Memphis is situated at thesouthwest corner of the State and is a leading commercial centreof the South. Swamiji stayed at Memphis for ten days as theguest of Mr. Hu L. Brinkley, who was a boarder at what wasknown as Miss Moon\u2019s establishment, or the La SaletteAcademy. (Actually, the La Salette Academy was nonexistent,having been closed in 1891.) Memphis received the Swamivery enthusiastically, so much so that after he had deliveredhis third lecture, which was his last fixture, on 17 January, hewas persuaded to stay on till the 22nd, and deliver three morelectures. The lectures were reported more fully and accuratelyLECTURE TOUR IN THE MID-WEST AND THE SOUTHSWAMI VIVEKANANDA730in the local newspapers, particularly in the Appeal Avalancheand the Memphis Commercial than in those of the cities hehad visited so far in his lecture tour. The reporter of the latterpaper had an interview with him on 15 January, which was incertain respects unique, as it was the basis of an article thatwas published in the paper on the following  day, giving a verypleasing description of the Swami\u2019s personality and anexposition by him of some of the essential doctrines of hisfaith. The reporter of the Appeal Avalanche, who was presentat a discussion held by Swamiji at the La Salette Academy on21 January 1894 was also very appreciative of Swamiji andgave a valuable account of the discussion as also a \u201cclose rangeword picture\u201d of him in the columns of his paper.Swamiji\u2019s first lecture at Memphis was delivered at theNineteenth Century Club on 15 January 1894. We do not knowwhat the subject of this lecture was and, possibly becauseadmission at the meeting was restricted to the members of theNineteenth Century Club and invited guests, it was not reportedin the papers. However, a few days later (21 January) the AppealAvalanche wrote about it and said that both the address andthe reception given after it were among \u201cthe most pleasantevents of this eventful year in club calendar\u201d. Swamiji\u2019s secondlecture, which was delivered at the Auditorium on 16 January,\u2014 the subject being Hinduism, \u2014 was announced in the AppealAvalanche in its issues of 15 and 16 January along with highpraise for the speaker. \u201c `One of the giants of the platform\u2019, `amodel representative of his race,\u2019 `a sensation of the World\u2019sFair parliament,\u2019 `an orator by divine right\u2019. All this and moreis true of Swami Vivekananda, the Hindu Monk, who is in thiscity. . . .\u201d, wrote the paper on 15 January. It spoke even moreenthusiastically about him in its issue of 16 January. Afterreferring to his \u201cmatchless oratory, deep penetration into things731occult, his cleverness in debate and great earnestness\u201d the paperwent on to say as follows, \u201cIn conversation, he is a most pleasantgentleman; his choice of words are the gems of the Englishlanguage, and his general bearing ranks him with the mostcultured people of Western etiquette and custom. As acompanion he is a most charming man, and as aconversationalist he is, perhaps,  not surpassed in the drawingrooms of any city in the Western World. He speaks English notonly distinctly but fluently, and his ideas, as new as sparkling,drop from his tongue in a perfectly bewildering overflow ofornamental language. . . . He has acquired a knowledge thathas given him a worldwide reputation as one of the mostthoughtful scholars of the age\u201d.The Memphis Commercial, which gave an account ofSwamiji\u2019s lecture at the Auditorium on 16 January said, interalia, as follows. \u201cThe address might fitly be called a plea foruniversal tolerance, illustrated by remarks concerning thereligion of India. . . . His talk concerning Hinduism was notstrictly circumstantial. His attempt was rather to give an analysisof its spirit than a story of its legends or picture of its forms. .. . He explained how his religion ignored the differentiationsof time, how, just as all men believe the present and the futureof the soul, so the faith of Brahma believes in its past. He madeit clear, too, how his faith does not believe in `original sin\u2019, butbases all effort and aspiration on the belief of the perfectibilityof humanity. . . . This perfection must come through the practiceof holiness and love. Here he showed how his own people havepracticed these qualities. . . . The Hindus, he says, hold thatthere is good in all religions. . . . He illustrated this by a citationfrom the Vedas, in which varied religions are symbolized asthe differently formed vessels with which different men comeLECTURE TOUR IN THE MID-WEST AND THE SOUTHSWAMI VIVEKANANDA732to bring water from a spring. The forms of the vessels are many,but the water of truth is what all seek to fill their vessels with\u201d.Swamiji\u2019s third lecture at Memphis was delivered in therooms of the Woman\u2019s Council on 17 January 1894 and hisaudience, which was \u2018moderately large\u2019, included some of themost distinguished members of the legal fraternity and financialinstitutions. The subject was the \u201cDestiny of Man\u201d and, refutingthe idea of original sin, Swamiji declared (as he had done atthe Parliament of Religions), \u201cPurity is our real nature, and toregain that is the object of all religion\u201d. His audience loudlyapplauded as he said, \u201cWhen Adam fell he fell from purity\u201dbut, as at Chicago, the statement must have sounded asanathema to the orthodox clergy outside. (Actually on 22January the paper published a sermon delivered by the Rev.Mr. Sullivan, whose theme was a Biblical text often cited atthe Parliament of Religions, \u201cFor I am not ashamed of theGospel of Christ\u201d. In the course of his sermon, the learnedclergyman roundly described the Parliament as the \u201cgreatestfraud of the nineteenth century\u201d and, citing the errorspropounded there, particularly mentioned the doctrine of thetransmigration of souls, giving a caricatured version of thetheory.)To come back to the lecture, Swamiji answered someobjections that could be raised to his statement that \u201call menare pure; all men are good\u201d. Why are some men brutes? \u201cThatman you call a brute,\u201d said he, \u201cis like the diamond in the dirtand dust \u2014 brush the dust off and it is a diamond, just as pureas if the dust had never been on it, and we must admit thatevery soul is a big diamond\u201d. He explained the point furtherby narrating a story that, by the way, he had heard from SriRamakrishna. \u201cA lioness once fell upon a flock of sheep and733killed a lamb. A sheep found a very young lion and she gave itsuck, and it grew up with the sheep and learned to eat grasslike a sheep. One day an old lion saw the sheep lion but it ranaway as he approached. The big lion waited till he caught thesheep lion alone, and he seized it and carried it to a clear poolof water, and said, `You are not a sheep, but a lion; look at yourpicture in the water.\u2019 The sheep lion, seeing its picture reflectedfrom the water, said, `I am a lion and not a sheep\u2019. Let us notthink that we are sheep, but be lions and don\u2019t bleat and eatgrass like a sheep\u201d.Religion, Swamiji went on to say, is love \u2014 unfolding,expanding, growing. It is like the spring within a watch that,when wound up, tries to regain its natural state. It is notnecessary that all watches have the same kind of a spring, andit is not necessary that we all have the same religion. And whyshould we quarrel? If we all had the same ideas the world wouldbe dead. External motion we call action; internal motion ishuman thought, Whirlpools show the strength of the current;stop the current and stagnation comes. We must have unityand variety. The rose would smell as sweet by any other name,and it does not matter what your religion is called. Swamijinarrated the story of the five blind men (that he had narrated ata lecture at Minneapolis) who touched five different limbs ofan elephant and quarreled angrily with each other as to whatthe animal was like, since each thought that it was like what ithad felt it to be by his touch. \u201cThat is what is the matter withour religion,\u201d said Swamiji. \u201cWe let the blind see the elephant\u201d.He denounced bigotry and declared, as he had done at theParliament at Chicago, that as all streams flow into the ocean,all religions bring us to God. He continued to speak in thisstrain for nearly two hours, drawing frequent applause, andconcluded by saying, \u201cLet us help, and not destroy\u201d.LECTURE TOUR IN THE MID-WEST AND THE SOUTHSWAMI VIVEKANANDA734At the importunate request of his already large following,Swamiji, as we have stated above, stayed on at Memphis till22 January 1894, delivering three more lectures. The first twoof these were delivered at La Salette Academy (Miss Moon\u2019sboardinghouse), and the subjects were respectively\u201cReincarnation\u201d and \u201cManners and Customs of India\u201d, 19 and20 January. The audience consisted mostly of ladies, to whomhe had become \u201clike the latest sensation\u201d, and they interruptedhim frequently by putting to him various questions, bothrelevant and irrelevant. The last and the most stirring of  hislectures was on \u201cComparative Theology\u201d and was delivered atthe Young Men\u2019s Hebrew Association Hall on 22 January.Meanwhile, on 21 January, he held a discussion in the parloursof La Salette Academy, at which, as we have said above, areporter of the Appeal Avalanche was present \u2014 a fortunatefact, for he gave a nice account of the discussions, which waspublished in the paper. It is worth mentioning, especially inview of the fact that earning money has been considered bysome writers as the chief motive of Swamiji\u2019s deliveringlectures in America, and even of his coming to that country,that all the lectures that he delivered at Memphis, except thelast one, were delivered in aid of charities in the city. Theproceeds of many other lectures delivered elsewhere, for aughtthat we know, may have been donated by him similarly. Fromthis, and also from the fact that much of his earnings weremulcted by the lecture bureau during the period of hisassociation with them (they made him also, as we shall seelater, pay heavily for the release that he eventually securedfrom them), it would appear (his own personal expenses beingpretty heavy) that his net earnings in America wereoverestimated. On 21 September 1894 he wrote to Alasinga,\u201cThere is no scope for money for our project here\u201d.735In his lecture on \u201cReincarnation,\u201d Swami Vivekanandasubstantiated the theory by scientific arguments, as he had donein an earlier lecture on the subject at Evanston (see above).Here he put equal emphasis on the moral basis of the theory.\u201cAll of us believe in a moral governor of the universe; yetnature reveals to us, instead of justice, injustice\u201d, said he. Oneman, he continued, is born under the best of circumstances,and has everything readymade to his hands. Another man hasjust the opposite experience. The theory of metempsychosisreconciles this disharmonious chord in our common beliefs.Instead of making us immoral, it gives us the idea of justice. .. . \u201cGod\u2019s  will is not an answer,\u201d said he. \u201cThe sole cause andwhole theory of causation being left with God, makes him amost immoral creature\u201d. He narrated the story of his meetingwith a cowboy in a train as he was leaving Minneapolis. Onhearing that he was a Hindu this man, who was a Presbyterianof the blue nose type, promptly declared that he must then goto hell. But when he explained to him the theory ofmetempsychosis, he said that he believed in it, because he hadone day a curious experience. When he was chopping woodone day, he said, his sister came out in his clothes and said sheused to be a man. Another beauty in this theory, said Swamiji,was that it supplied a \u201cmoral motor (motive)\u201d. It said, \u201cWhatis done is done. . . . Don\u2019t put your finger in the fire again.Every moment is a new chance\u201d.Swamiji\u2019s lecture on \u201cThe Manners and Customs ofIndia\u201d was poorly attended on account of inclement weatherand was only briefly reported. But his last lecture in the city,entitled \u201cComparative Theology\u201d, was well attended and highlyappreciated. It was described in the Appeal Avalanche reportas \u201cthe blue-ribbon lecture of the series\u201d. In the course of thelecture Swamiji traced the history of man\u2019s beliefs concerningLECTURE TOUR IN THE MID-WEST AND THE SOUTHSWAMI VIVEKANANDA736God from the state of the savage when man quaked in fear andterror of some malignant spirit, whom he tried to propitiate,through ancestral worship and polytheism to monotheism, whenall gods were blended into one, the God of Gods, and throughthis to the idea that God was the universe, and that \u201cthe soul ofmy soul is the only true existence\u201d. He dwelt briefly with theprincipal religions of the world, such as Buddhism, Islam, andChristianity and then, answering the question, \u201cAre they alltrue, or are some of them true, and some are false?\u201d, observedas follows, \u201cThey have all reached one conclusion, that of anabsolute and infinite existence. . . . The multiple of phenomenathat is seen at every hand is only the infinite variety of unity\u201d.\u201cIf you put a simple molecule of air in the bottom of aglass of water it at once begins to struggle to join the infiniteatmosphere above. So it is with the soul. It is struggling toregain its pure nature and to free itself from this material body.It wants to regain its own infinite expansion. This is everywherethe same. Among Christians, Buddhists, Mohammedans,agnostic or priest, the soul is struggling. A river flows a thousandmiles down the circuitous mountain side to where it joins thesea and a man is standing there to tell it to go back and startanew and assume a more direct course. That man is a fool. Youare a river that flows from the heights of Zion. I flow from thelofty peaks of the Himalayas. I don\u2019t say to you, go back andcome down as I did, you\u2019re wrong. That is more wrong thanfoolish. Stick to your beliefs. The truth is never lost. Booksmay perish, nations may go down in a crash, but the truth ispersevered, and is taken up by some man and handed back tosociety, which proves a grand and continuous revelation ofGod\u201d.737What profound wisdom, hope and faith, love and charityare contained in the words we have just quoted! The wordsthrilled his audience, and even in the form of a printed summarythat has come down to us retain their charm and their appeal.No wonder that the Appeal Avalanche reporter said that withoutdoubt it increased the general admiration that the people ofMemphis had for the Swami. This gentleman who, as we havesaid above, was present at a discussion held by Swamiji at LaSalette Academy, has given an account of it that was publishedin his paper on the morning of 22 January and had contributedto the success of the lecture. A few topics dealt with in thisreport are worth mentioning here. He was highly appreciativeof Swamiji personally. \u201cBeing a gentleman by instinct, a scholarby training and a monk by choice he is always courteous andnever impatient. . . . There is throughout his bearing andconversation a certain childlike simplicity of manner that enlistsone\u2019s sympathy, and convinces one of the sincerity of the man\u2019sutterances before he begins to speak,\u201d says he about Swamiji.Perhaps what we must be most thankful to this reporterfor is that he drew Swamiji out at length on his views on thequestion, \u201cIf Hinduism is all that you claim it is, why it has notelevated you among the nations of the world?\u201d We have seenearlier that this was a question Swamiji was called upon toanswer pretty frequently wherever he went in the West. Usuallyalso it was accompanied by a praise for Christianity on thescore of the material benefits it has allegedly conferred on theChristian nations of the West, and also used as an argument infavour of the view that Christianity is superior to all otherreligions on earth. More often than not, back of the questioner\u2019smind lay the further query, \u201cWhat right has a member of asubject race to preach religion to Westerners, when the falsityof his religion is proved by his political degradation, and theLECTURE TOUR IN THE MID-WEST AND THE SOUTHSWAMI VIVEKANANDA738superiority of Christianity is established by the politicalsupremacy of its followers?\u201d These questions persisted in theWestern mind even in later days and when Mr. Bipin ChandraPal was on a visit to America and gave some lectures on thereligion of the Brahmo Samaj, he was quietly told by anAmerican, who was a great admirer of India and her religiousthought, that his place was not in America but in his owncountry. Explaining himself, this gentleman affirmed that theworld would not receive its lessons, however true and loftythey might be, from a slave. He said that, before deliveringtheir spiritual message to the West, Indians should be able to\u201clook civilized humanity in the face\u201d. The lesson that Mr. Paldrew from this episode was  that it was their first duty to workfor the liberation of their country.65Whether Swamiji, who had, as we have said above,similar experiences, drew the same lessons, raises some issueswhich are beside our point here. But replying to the questionerbefore him, he went into deeper issues, viz., the true functionof religion, and its relation to human life. He asserted that toelevate material conditions is not the sphere of any religion.He denied also that any religion had ever advanced the thought,or inspiration of an individual, or a nation. As regards the claimsof Christianity in this regard, he said that it had not proved tobe an exception. \u201cYour Darwins, your Mills, your Humes, havenever received the endorsement of your prelates,\u201d he pointedout. He, however, agreed \u201cto a certain extent\u201d with hisquestioner\u2019s assertion that one would not \u201cgive a fig for a faiththat does not tend to elevate mankind\u2019s lot on earth as well ashis spiritual condition\u201d. (As we know, he fully endorsed SriRamakrishna\u2019s statement that one cannot have religion in anempty belly.) But he denied the truth of the statement that wasoften made and was advanced by this questioner, that739Christianity had founded colleges and hospitals, etc., and raisedthe degenerate. Swamiji asserted that these were not the directresults of Christianity.Said Swamiji, \u201cReligious thought should be directed todeveloping man\u2019s spiritual side. Science, art, learning andmetaphysical research have their proper functions in life, butif you seek to blend them, you destroy their individualcharacteristics until, in time, you eliminate your spiritual, forinstance, from the religious altogether. You Americans worshipwhat? The dollar. In the mad rush for gold, you forget thespiritual until you have become a nation of materialists. Evenyour preachers and churches are tainted with the all-pervadingdesire. Show me one in the history of your people, who has ledthe spiritual  life that those whom I can name at home havedone. Where are those who, when death comes, could say, `OBrother Death, I welcome thee\u2019. Your religion helps you buildFerris wheels and Eiffel towers, but does it aid you in thedevelopment of your inner lives?\u201d Objecting, a man presentsaid, \u201cIn pursuing the spiritual, you lose sight of the demandsof the present. Your doctrines do not help men to live\u201d. \u201cIthelps them to die,\u201d Swamiji answered. \u201cThe aim of the idealreligion,\u201d the man persisted, \u201cshould be to help one to live andto prepare one to die at the same time\u201d. \u201cExactly,\u201d Swamijiquickly replied, \u201cand it is that which we are seeking to attain.I believe that the Hindu faith has developed the spiritual in itsdevotees at the expense of the material, and I think that, in theWestern world, the contrary is true. By uniting the materialismof the West with the spiritualism of the East, I believe muchcan be done\u201d. About a month later, at Detroit, asked if this waspossible \u2014 if the placidity of spirit that prevails in India couldbe found in the combative western countries \u2014 Swamiji said,\u201cMay not one combine the energy of the lion with the gentlenessLECTURE TOUR IN THE MID-WEST AND THE SOUTHSWAMI VIVEKANANDA740Chicago, 1894741Harriet McKendleyMary HaleSWAMI VIVEKANANDA742of the lamb?\u201d That indeed still remains the great question inthe world after the nations of the West have waged twodevastating world wars and on the answer to this hangs theirfate and along with theirs that of the rest of the world, for ifthere is another world war, it may produce a nuclear holocaustthat may wipe out humanity.Swamiji left Memphis on 22 January 1894 and arrivedat Chicago in time to keep an engagement there on the eveningof the 25th. He seems to have remained there till he left for hisengagements at Detroit some three weeks later on 12 February1894. We know nothing about what Swamiji was doing duringthis time. It is possible he took rest \u2014 he had had a strenuoustime at Memphis where he had delivered six lectures in abouteight, or nine days, attended a discussion party and severalreception parties and, during both day and night met numerouspeople, including press reporters. It is just as possible that hehad no rest during these three weeks and that he was deliveringlectures, about which we have yet to know anything. At thistime definitely he was engaged to the lecture bureau, and thelatter, having had their eyes fixed solely on their profits,probably kept him busy.VISwamiji seems to have spent these three weeks at Chicagowith the Hales, whose home there, as he informed his brotherdisciples in Calcutta in a letter written in 1894 (the exact datenot quoted) was his \u201ccentre\u201d. We have already narrated howMrs. Hale had befriended him on the day of his arrival atChicago to attend the Parliament of Religions. Mrs. Hale\u2019s actof kindness was unforgettable and during his subsequent visits743to her place he had come to know the other members of the\u201choly family\u201d (as he called them) personally and intimatelyand formed very high opinions of them all. As we have saidabove, he addressed Mrs. Hale as mother and her daughters,Mary and Harriet and Mr. Hale\u2019s nieces (sister\u2019s daughters),Isabelle and Harriet McKindley, who lived with them (the four\u201cHale sisters\u201d as he called them) as his own sisters, and theyall fully reciprocated his feelings towards them. He wrote in aletter to Mary and Harriet on 28 November, 1896, \u201cI think, forwhatever reasons, I love best all four of you and I proudlybelieve that you four also love me equally like that\u201d.66 Mrs.Hale was quite orthodox in her religious faith67 and perhapsdid not subscribe to Swamiji\u2019s universalism but that did notstand in the way of her extending to the young monk motherlylove and genuine sympathy. As regards Mr. G. W. Hale, Swamijihad a profound regard for him, and Mr. Hale\u2019s love for andunbounded confidence in Swamiji are proved by the fact thatin those critical days when Christian  missionaries were carryingon a campaign against Swamiji, stooping so low as to inventscandals about him, the Hales\u2019 faith in him remained unshaken.They refused to comply with the advice given by \u201cfriends\u201dthat Swamiji should not be allowed to mix with their girls.Indeed, whenever Mr. Hale received letters from anonymousaccusers of Swamiji, he promptly threw them into the fire. Oneday, as he flung one such letter to the fire, he told his wife, \u201cIfthat man is a fraud, I\u2019ll not believe in God\u201d. Swamiji was notexaggerating his attachment to the Hale family when, in a letterto Mary Hale from India on 2 March 189868, he wrote, \u201cYouare all so kind, the whole family, to me, I must have belongedto you in the past as we Hindus say\u201d.In a letter to Swami Ramakrishnananda on 25 September1894, Swami Vivekananda wrote about the Hales as follows,THE HALE SISTERSSWAMI VIVEKANANDA744\u201cI shall now tell you something of the Hales to whose addressyou direct my letters. He and his wife are an old couple, havingtwo daughters, two nieces, and a son. The son lives abroadwhere he earns a living. The daughters live at home. . . . All thefour are young and not yet married. Marriage is a verytroublesome business here. In the first place one must have ahusband after one\u2019s heart. Secondly, he must be a moneyedman. . . . This is the general rule; moreover the Hale girls arehandsome, rich, `university girls\u2019 \u2014 unrivalled for dancing,singing, and playing on the piano; and though many youngmen are after them, the girls won\u2019t have them. They willprobably live unmarried; besides they are now full ofrenunciation through my contact and are busy with thoughts ofBrahman. . . . The two daughters are blondes, that is, havegolden hair, while the two nieces are brunettes, that is, of darkhair. They know all sorts of occupation. The nieces are not sorich, they conduct a kindergarten school;  but the daughters donot earn. . . . The daughters call me brother, and I address theirmother as mother. All my things are at their place; and theylook after them wherever I go\u201d.69We do not know whether, whenever Swamiji was atChicago, he stayed with the Hales as their guest. As we haveseen above, during the Parliament days, he lived with the Lyons,and Miss Conger says in her reminiscences that on his secondvisit to the city, Mrs. Lyon had helped him find a simple butcomfortable flat. He may not have lived at that flat long beforehe was persuaded to come over and stay with them by the Hales.This did not relieve him very much monetarily for, as he wroteto Alasinga once (28 May 1894),70 \u201cmoney has to fly, althoughI have been almost always taken care of everywhere by thenicest and the highest families\u201d. As elder brother, he insistedon giving some presents to the girls occasionally, as we learn745from a letter he wrote to Isabelle McKindley, as follows, \u201cIfyou want anything from New York or Boston which cannot behad at Chicago \u2014 write sharp. I have plenty of dollars now. Iwill send you over anything you want in a minute. Don\u2019t thinkit would be indelicate anyway \u2014 no humbug about me. If I ama brother so I am \u2014 I hate only one thing in the world,hypocrisy\u201d71. Occasionally, it seems, he gave the Hales somecostly presents. In a letter to Haridas Vihari Das Desai on 20June 1894, he requested him to send him a few carpets madein Agra and Lahore, so that he could make a present of them tothe Hales. The Americans, Swamiji said, liked Indian carpetsvery much for use in covering their floors.72 Similarly, heaccepted presents that they gave him. On 17 March 1894, hewrote to Isabelle, who had sent him at Detroit a package, \u201cSorrythat you sent those stockings \u2014 I could have got some myselfhere. Glad that it shows your love\u201d.73It was not merely because these highly gifted girls boundhim to them by their unselfish, sisterly affection that onoccasions he stayed at their home as a guest but because hehad a high regard for all the members of the Hale family. In aletter he wrote to Swami Ramakrishna-nanda, referred to above,he said, \u201cI scarcely find a family so highly pure and kind. Orwhy should God shower His blessings on them in suchabundance, my brother? Oh, how wonderfully kind they are!If they chance to learn that a poor man is in a street at such andsuch a place, there they will go, ladies and gentlemen, to givehim food and clothing, and find him some job. And what dowe do!\u201d74 The deep love he bore the sisters similarly sprangfrom his genuine appreciation of their virtues. He thought thatthey were not meant to live worldly lives and that they hadspiritual potentialities. In a letter to them, dated 26 June 1894,he clearly expressed his views about them and exhorted themTHE HALE SISTERSSWAMI VIVEKANANDA746to live higher lives. He said, \u201cMay even the dust of the worldnever touch you, for, after all, as the poets say, it is only a pieceof carrion, covered over with garlands. Touch it not \u2014 if youcan. Come up, young ones of the bird of Paradise, before yourfeet touch the cesspool of corruption, this world and flyupwards. `O thou that art awake, do not go to sleep again.\u201d 75In another letter to them about a month later, 31 July1894, written shortly after he had attended and enjoyed theGreenacre Religious Conference of which we shall saysomething in a subsequent Chapter, he had some harsh wordsto say about Americans, and in very moving language askedthe girls (they believed in Christian Science) to seek the highestreality \u2014 God. About Americans (and specially ChristianScientists who participated in this Conference), he said, \u201cOnething \u2014 they are a dry sort of people here \u2014 and as to that fewpeople in the whole world are there that are not. They do notunderstand  `Madhava\u2019, the Sweet One. They are eitherintellectual, or go after faith cure, table turning, witchcraft,etc. Nowhere have I heard so much about `love, life, andliberty\u2019, as in this country but nowhere it is less understood.Here God is either a terror or a healing power, vibration, andso forth\u201d. Then, addressing the girls, he said, \u201cNow, gooddreams, good thoughts for you. You are good and noble. Insteadof materializing the spirit, that is dragging the spiritual to thematerial plane as these folks do, convert the matter into spirit,catch a glimpse at least, every day, of that world of infinitebeauty and peace and purity \u2014 the spiritual, and try to live init day and night. . . .\u201dThe last paragraph of this remarkable letter must bequoted in full: the words not only give us an idea of the state ofblessedness that he himself was experiencing, but the fervour747of his appeal to those whom he loved to have their share of it.\u201cStick to God. Who cares what comes to the body or to anythingelse. Through the terrors of evil, say \u2014 my God, my love.Through the pangs of death, say \u2014 my God, my love. Throughall the evils under the sun, say \u2014 my God, my love. Thou arthere, I see Thee. Thou art with me, I feel Thee. I am Thine,take me. I am not of the world\u2019s, but Thine, leave not then me.Do not go for glass beads leaving the mine of diamonds. Thislife is a great chance. What, seekest thou the pleasure of theworld \u2014 He is the fountain of all bliss. Seek for the highest,aim at that highest and you shall reach the highest\u201d.76Even though he urged the \u2018sisters\u2019, specially Mary, to beabove the joys and sorrows of the world and be steadfast inGod, he did not want that they should renounce the world andlive like pale faced nuns. When Harriet Hale married, he feltvery happy and we find him poking fun at Mary of supposedlywaiting for a millionaire to turn up and offer her his hand.Humorously he told her that he also was interested in amillionaire  husband for her for, said he, \u201cI must have my money,don\u2019t forget\u201d.77 \u201cThough Harriet has got one of a million virtues,a few millions of cash virtue would have made it more shining,I am sure; so you do not commit the same mistake\u201d, wrote heto her on 2 March 1898. In a letter written in September 1899,78he said, \u201cHarriet Woolley has been uniformly silent. Nevermind, I will bide my time, and as soon as Mr. Woolley becomesa millionaire, demand my money\u201d. At one time he had heardthat Mary was going to marry and as at the very time shehappened to slow down her correspondence with him, he wroteto her as follows (16 March 1899), \u201cBy the way, Mary, I hearda few months ago, when I was rather worrying over your longsilence, that you were just hooking a \u2018Willy\u2019, and so busy withdances and parties; that explained of course your inability toTHE HALE SISTERSSWAMI VIVEKANANDA748write, but \u2018Willy\u2019 or no \u2018Willy\u2019, I must have my money, don\u2019tforget\u201d.79 On 27 December 1899, he again wrote to her, \u201cYoucould not get the millionaire. Why don\u2019t you start for half orone fourth million? Something is better than nothing. We wantmoney; he may go into Lake Michigan, we have not the leastobjection\u201d.80 (After Mr. Hale\u2019s death, his family migrated toFlorence, along with some other Chicago families. Maryeventually married a wealthy Florentine, CommendatoriMatteini.81 In a letter to the Prabuddha Bharata, quoted in thatpaper in its issue of January, 1949, Miss MacLeod stated thatwhen she met Mary in Florence she found her reading Swamiji\u2019sworks and suggested that she should rather send Swamiji somemoney, which he badly needed. Miss MacLeod further saidthat thereupon Mary sent Swamiji $15,000. This cannot becorrect for when Mary could send such an amount \u2014 onlyafter her marriage \u2014 Swamiji was no more. It is possible thatshe sent a donation to the Belur Math after Swamiji\u2019s death,but we could not get any information about it when we madean enquiry there.)Though Swamiji continued to urge Mary, sometimesusing the language of jest, but always in deep earnestness, tomarry, it is clear from a letter that he wrote to her as far back as17 September 1896, that from his study of his sisters, he hadcome to some definite conclusions as to their prospects inmatrimony. He wrote, \u201cNow, my dear Mary, I shall tell you agreat lesson I have learnt in this life. It is this: \u2018The higher yourideal the more miserable you are;\u2019 for such a thing as an idealcannot be attained in the world, or in this life even. He whowants perfection in this world is a mad man, for it cannot be. .. . How can you find the infinite in the finite? Therefore I tellyou, Harriet will have a most blessed and happy life, becauseshe is not so imaginative and sentimental as to make a fool of749herself. . . . She has enough of sentiments as to make life sweetand enough of commonsense and gentleness as to soften thehard points in life, which must come to everyone. So has HarrietMcKindley in a still higher degree. She is just the girl to makethe best of wives. As for you and Isabelle, I will tell you thetruth and my language is plain. . . . You, Mary, are like amettlesome Arab \u2014 grand, splendid. You will make a splendidqueen. . . . You will shine along a dashing, bold, adventurous,heroic husband; but my dear sister, you will make one of theworst of wives. You will take the life out of our easygoing,practical, plodding husbands of the everyday world. ...Therefore my advice to you until you bring down your idealsto a more practical level, you ought not to marry\u201d. Swamijiwent on to say that there were two sorts of persons in the world\u2014 one, not given to much imagination, yet good, kind, sweet,etc., the other, with high-strung nerves, tremendouslyimaginative, always going high one moment and coming downthe next. The first class will be happy, the second ever runbetween ecstasy and misery. The second, if they want to begreat, must fight to finish, \u2018clear the deck for battle,\u2019 and mustattach themselves to but one  idea, and live and die for that. Heplaced himself in this class, to which he thought Mary andIsabelle also belonged. But then, said he, they must \u201cclear thedeck,\u201d choose once and for all between either \u2018bhog\u2019 or \u2018yoga\u2019.Achieve happiness or achieve greatness, he told Mary: be happyas Harriet has been, or be great.82 He struck the same note in aletter to her written as late as 21 August 1901, which,incidentally, was perhaps the last letter he wrote to her, \u2014\u201cWhat I am exercised with just this moment is, that you get alittle bit of manliness about you. Oh! Mary, your brain, health,beauty, everything is going to waste just for lack of that oneessential \u2014assertion of individuality. Your haughtiness, spirit,THE HALE SISTERSSWAMI VIVEKANANDA750etc. are all nonsense, only mockery; you are at best a boardingschool girl, no backbone! no backbone!\u201d83With all that, it was not the Harriets who, in his opinion,were sensible, but the mettlesome Arabs, Mary and Isabelle,and specially the former who, he thought, was \u201crusting away asplendid brain and abilities,\u201d whom Swamiji found to be \u201cthemost companionable\u201d. To Mary he wrote the largest numberof letters, about 46, or more, (the next number is 41 to Alasinga)that he wrote to one person, the calculation being from hispublished correspondence. These letters touch on all subjects\u2014 from the state of his health to Brahma \u2014 and express avariety of moods, \u2014 humorous and grave, commonplace andsublime. They include an interesting correspondence that theyhad with each other in verse, and is quoted in full in C.W.84 Wegive here a verse or two:The Swami \u2014So Mary Hale,Allow me tellYou mar my doctrines, wronging, baulking.I never taughtSuch queer thoughtThat all was God \u2014 unmeaning talking.But this I say,Remember pray,That God is true, all else is nothing.The world\u2019s a dreamThough true it seemAnd only truth is He the living.The real me is none but He.And never, never matter changing.Mary \u2014751The difference I clearly see\u2018Twixt tweedledum and tweedledee \u2014That is a proposition saneBut truly \u2019tis beyond my veinTo make your Eastern logic plain.If \u201cGod is truth, all else is naught,\u201dThis \u201cworld a dream,\u201d delusion up wrought,What can exist which God is not?....So again I sayIn my poor way,I cannot see but that all\u2019s HeIf I\u2019m in Him and He in me.Some of the sublimest thoughts that Swami Vivekanandahas given to the world, it is interesting to note, were first givento Mary in letters to her. One among these, addressed to all thesisters, beginning with \u2018Stick to God!\u2019 we have already quotedabove. That wonderful declaration of his faith, one among themost characteristic of Swami Vivekananda\u2019s ideas, that  SriAurobindo quoted in one of his works and has been quoted byus in Chapter I, \u201cI have lost all wish for my salvation, may I beborn again and again and suffer thousands of miseries\u2026etc.\u201d,was first given to Mary, in his letter to her dated 9 July 1897.85So, also, in his letter to her dated 28 March 1900 are found thefollowing wonderful words, which we quote in full withoutapologies. \u201cNow I am going to be truly Vivekananda. Did youever enjoy evil? Ha! Ha! you silly girl, all is good! Nonsense.Some good, some evil. I enjoy the good and I enjoy the evil. Iwas Jesus and I was Judas Iscariot; both my play, my fun. `Solong as there are two, fear shall not leave thee\u2019. Ostrich method?Hide your heads in the sand and think there is nobody seeingyou! All is good! Be brave and face everything, come good,come evil, both welcome, both of you my play. I have no goodTHE HALE SISTERSSWAMI VIVEKANANDA752to attain, no ideal to clench up to, no ambition to fulfil; I, thediamond mine, am playing with pebbles, good and evil; goodfor you, evil, come; good for you, good, you come too. If theuniverse tumbles round my ears, what is that to me? I am Peacethat passeth understanding; understanding only gives us goodor evil. I am beyond, I am peace\u201d.86 Swami Vivekananda\u2019s letterto Mary dated 1 November 189687 contains a lucid expositionof his principal philosophical ideas and his vision of the idealstate.88Swami Vivekananda confided to Mary his views onBritish rule in India, \u2014 views which he could express publiclyin India, or even in America, only at a great risk. \u201cSuppose yousimply publish this letter,\u201d he told Mary, \u201cthe law just passedin India will allow the English government in India to drag mefrom here and kill me without trial.\u201d (He was writing fromRidgely Manor on 30 October 1899.)89 He conceded that Britishrule in India had one redeeming feature: it had brought her outonce more on the stage of the world. If this had been done withan eye to the good of the people it would have, as circumstanceshad favoured Japan with, produced more wonderful results,said he. \u201cNo good can be done when the main idea isbloodsucking,\u201d added he. In spite of massacres (as after therising of 1857) and recurring famines \u201cthat take off millions\u201dthe population of India had increased, said he, but it had notyet come up to what it was before Muslim rule. (He quoted theMuslim historian Ferishta, circa 1570 to 1611 A.D., as sayingthat in the 12th century the Hindus numbered 600 million,whereas, said he, it was now less than 200 million.) India canwell support five times the present population, he said.He spoke about the strangling of the press, the bit ofself-government that was given to India being quickly taken753off, the poor prospects for educational expansion, and Indianshaving been (of course) disarmed long ago. \u201cFor writing a fewwords of innocent criticism men are being hurried totransportation for life, others imprisoned without any trial; andnobody knows when his head will be off.... There has been areign of terror in India for some years. English soldiers arekilling our men and outraging our women \u2014 only to be senthome with passage and pension at our expense. We are in aterrible gloom \u2014 where is the Lord? Mary, you can afford tobe optimistic \u2014 can I?\u201d Was Swamiji misrepresenting, orexaggerating facts? In support of his statement about Britishsoldiers killing Indians and outraging women with impunityonly two instances may suffice and we cite them here. In thefirst case, several soldiers of a British battalion \u201coutraged anative woman to death\u201d, and in the second an Indian cook wasbeaten to death \u201cfor having refused to procure a native womanfor them\u201d, the culprits being two troopers of famous Britishcavalry regiment. In the first case, even on Lord Curzon\u2019sintervention, nothing more than some disciplinary action wastaken, and in the second case the offenders got scot  free. Wemay add that not only British soldiers but British civilians weresometimes guilty of offences such as these, and that alwaysthey either had no punishment, or got off with ludicrously lowsentences.90Swami Vivekananda\u2019s letters to Mary and the other Halesisters are epistolary gems, both for style and content, and theiroutstanding feature is absolute frankness. He did not refrainfrom expressing to them his disappointment with some waysof the life of Americans, and he did so in unambiguous terms.A letter to them dated 31 July 1894, quoted by us once, above,contained a somewhat sweeping denunciation of Americans.\u201cNowhere have I heard so much about `love, life, and liberty\u2019THE HALE SISTERSSWAMI VIVEKANANDA754as in this country, but nowhere it is less understood,\u201d said he.In a letter to Mary dated 8 July 1897 from Almora he defendedwhat he had once said in a lecture in America about \u201cthe verychurchy women of America and their power of inventingscandals\u201d. \u201cSupposing I have said all sorts of fearful thingsagainst `Yanks\u2019 \u2014 would that be paying off a millionth part ofwhat they say of our mothers and sisters? `Neptune\u2019s waters\u2019would be perfectly useless to wash off the hatred that theChristian `Yanks\u2019 of both sexes bear to us, `heathens of India\u2019\u2014 and what harm have we done them? Except your family,Mrs. Bull, and a few other kind persons who else has beenkind to me?\u201d91Mary wrote to Swamiji one letter too many. Swamijihad once (sometime in January, 1895) had a very excitedargument with a Presbyterian gentleman, \u201cwho, as usual, gotvery hot, angry, and abusive\u201d (See Chapter 10, Section I below).Mrs. Bull, with a mother\u2019s privilege, severely reprimandedSwamiji for this. It is likely that Mrs. Hale also did so. (A letterfrom her to Swamiji dated 26 February, quoted by Mrs. Burkeon page 558 of the first edition of the work, but dropped in thesecond and third edition and on the ground that there is someuncertainty  about the date, seems to have a clear reference tothis incident. In this letter, no matter its date, Mrs. Hale sharplycriticized Swamiji for his \u201clapse\u201d.) It seems that Mary thoughtthat she also had the sister\u2019s privilege and that she wrote aletter giving advice to Swamiji as to how to get on in the world.We do not know what was Swamiji\u2019s reaction to the reprimandshe received from Mrs. Bull and Mrs. Hale, both of whom headdressed and respected as mother. But his reply to Mary (1February 1895) was forthright and, we may say, sharp. Heclearly stated his position thus: \u201cI know full well how good itis for one\u2019s worldly prospects to be sweet. I do everything to755be sweet, but when it comes to a horrible compromise with thetruth within, then I stop. I do not believe in humility. I believein Samadarshitva \u2014 same state of mind with regard to all,\u201d \u201cIam so sorry, Sister, that I cannot make myself sweet andaccommodating to every black falsehood.... I will die a thousanddeaths rather than lead a jellyfish existence and yield to everyrequirement of this foolish world\u201d. There are both anger andlove in the following sentence where he emphatically rejectsMary\u2019s suggestions, \u201cPooh! I try to pacify the priests! Sister,do not take this amiss. But you are babies and babies mustsubmit to be taught\u201d.92 We do not know what reply, if any,Mary gave to this letter, but we know that shortly afterwardsthey were engaged in a lively correspondence in verse (partlyquoted by us above) which shows that there was no bitternessleft in the mind of either of them. The rhymed correspondencebegan on 15 February 1895.There may have been a few more episodes like this andit would be wrong if they were considered as indicating a riftin the relations between Swamiji and the Hale family. Nor doesso, in our opinion, the following incident which, however,cannot be left out of account in a biography of Swamiji. It isbest given in Swamiji\u2019s own words in a letter to Sister Niveditafrom Los Angeles, California93. \u201cMrs. Leggett started a plan ofa $ 100 subscription each year for ten years to help me, andheaded the list with her $ 100 for 1900 and got two others todo the same. Then she went on writing letters to all my friendsasking each to join in it. When she went on writing to Mrs.Miller I was rather shy \u2014 but she did it before I knew. A verypolite but cold letter came to her in reply from Mrs. Hale,written by Mary, expressing inability and assuring her of theirlove for me. I am afraid Mrs. Hale and Mary are displeased.But it was not my fault at all....\u201d This letter is dated 15 FebruaryTHE HALE SISTERSSWAMI VIVEKANANDA7561900, and five days later, on 20 February, we find him writingto Mary a feeling letter of condolence on the death of her fatherwhich had occurred in early February. It is not clear whetherSwamiji knew about this sad event when he wrote the abovementioned letter to Sister Nivedita, or, for that matter, howand when he learned about it. In any case, after this we findhim writing frequently to Mary, and on 22 March he wrote thathe would come to Chicago early next month. On 28 March hewrote another letter, addressing her as \u201cWell Blessed Mary\u201d,which contained in a postscript the exalted thoughts, \u201cI wasJesus and I was Judas Iscariot; both my play, my fun\u201d, etc.,that we have quoted in full above. Needless to say, theyremained as friendly to each other as ever before and, evenafter he had returned to India, they frequently wrote to eachother.As we have said above, Swamiji wrote to Mary (moreoften than to anybody else) about many matters, commonplaceand sublime. In particular, it is to her that he wrote about hispersonal matters that are of great interest to us today \u2014 suchthings as his health, his prospects, etc. \u2014 which he would notwrite to others about. To her, e.g., he wrote, 28 April 1897,\u201cMy hair is turning grey in bundles, and my face is gettingwrinkled up all over.... And I am losing flesh rapidly, becauseI am made to live upon meat and meat alone \u2014 no bread, norice, no potatoes, not even a lump of sugar in my coffee\u201d. Orthat he was training a big beard, which was turning grey. \u201cItgives a venerable appearance and saves one from Americanscandalmongers. O thou white hair, how much cannot thouconceal, all glory unto thee, Hallelujah!\u201d He knew that suchmatters might not interest many people, but would not beconsidered as trivial by his loving sister Mary. It is to Maryalso more than to any other person that he communicated his757personal joys and sorrows. He sent her some glowingdescriptions of the hero\u2019s welcome that he received from hiscountrymen when he first returned from America. \u201cI am on thevery height of my destiny,\u201d he wrote to her from Ramnad on30 January 1897.94 To her again, he opened his heart, that wasladen with sorrows, towards the end of his life. \u201cI have workedfor this world, Mary, all my life and it does not give me a pieceof bread without taking a pound of flesh.... This is the world,hideous, beastly corpse. Who thinks of helping it is a fool....May the Lord take me to the other shore,\u201d he wrote to her on17 June 1900.95 She shared his lightheartedness too. In thisconnection we may narrate a story, which Mahendranath Dattaheard from Swamiji when they were living together in London.The incident happened when Swamiji was living in Chicagoat the house of the Hales. His toenails had grown large and heasked Mary for a knife, intending to pare them himself. She atonce fetched her manicure set, sat down at his feet on the carpetof the floor, took off his socks and shoes, carefully pared offthe nails of both the feet, and helped him put on the socks andshoes again. Sitting on the chair opposite him, she then said,mimicking the words a servant should have used for the service,\u201cPay me a dollar, Swamiji, as my remuneration. You wouldhave to pay it if you had it done in a barber\u2019s saloon\u201d. Shelaughed merrily. Swamiji laughed also and said humorously,\u201cYou have had the privilege of touching my feet and paringmy nails. You should pay me something for that!\u201d The twolaughed loudly together for some time.96One of the reasons why a biographer of SwamiVivekananda has to say more about Mary than about the othersisters is that we know more about her than about the others,and this is due to the fact that we have many more of Swamiji\u2019sletters to Mary than to the others. Recently, however, someTHE HALE SISTERSSWAMI VIVEKANANDA758letters of Swamiji written to Isabelle McKindley have beendiscovered and they show that she was perhaps as high inSwamiji\u2019s estimation as Mary. In one of these letters to Isabelle,acknowledging a package containing some stockings that shehad sent him and that made him happy, said he, because itshowed her love, he wrote to her as follows. \u201cThe great Buddhistprayer is, `I bow down to all holy men on earth\u2019. I feel the realmeaning of this prayer whenever I see a face upon which thefinger of the Lord has written in unmistakable letters, `mine\u2019.May you all be happy, blessed \u2014 good and pure for ever andever. May your feet never touch the mud and dirt of this terribleworld\u201d.97 We have quoted above from a letter to her in whichhe asked her without hesitation to write to him if she neededanything (his pocket at the moment being full of dollars),adding, \u201cNo humbug about me. If I am brother, so I am\u201d.Isabelle cheerfully did odd jobs for him and he took a keeninterest in her. Even after returning to India, he kept onenquiring about her in his letters to Mary.Isabelle was perhaps the most sparkling of all the fourgirls and she was a brilliant conversationalist, in the opinionof a niece of hers, Mrs. Hyder. Along with her sister, Isabelleconducted a kindergarten for the children of the well-to-dofamilies \u2014 an innovation in those days. She was strikinglyhandsome \u2014 her face resembling that of Venus de Melo, inthe statue of Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love and beautythat was found in the island of Melos in 1820 amongst theruins of the theatre and is now preserved in the Louvre. In aletter to Mary from Srinagar, Kashmir, dated 17 September1898, Swamiji jokingly referred to the resemblance as follows,\u201cHow is the lady that looks like a certain statue in Florence? (Ihave forgotten the name). I always bless her arms when I thinkof the comparison\u201d.98 The statue known as Venus de Melo, it759may be noted, is without arms, but it is considered asrepresenting the female human form at its best. There are manystatues of Aphrodite (known to the Romans as Venus) of ancienttimes, the most famous being that by Praxiteles (Venus ofCnidus), which was subsequently reproduced in various copies.In Florence there is a famous statue of the goddess, known asVenus de Medici, which Swamiji must have seen when he wason a visit to the city, but it is with arms. He must also haveseen the armless statue in the Louvre. In a letter to Mary fromCalcutta dated 30 May 1897, Swamiji said as follows, \u201cBy theway I saw the Venus of what do you call it \u2014 and you are right\u2014 Isabelle\u2019s face is much like that statue. Of course, her handsare better, for the statue has only stumps \u2014 that is to say, toour uneducated taste. Anyhow Isabelle is beautiful because sheis like Venus and that Venus is beautiful because she is likeIsabelle. On the whole I think she is much more beautiful thanthe statue, stumps notwithstanding\u201d.99 Isabelle did not marry,and died when she was still young.100Isabelle, according to Mrs. Hyder, was the dominant oneof the McKindley sisters; Harriet, who was \u201cmore drylyintellectual\u201d, \u201cbowed to her in everything\u201d. Swamiji\u2019s estimateof Harriet was perhaps a little different for, as we have saidabove, he considered her as \u201cjust the girl to make the best ofwives\u201d. She, however, did not marry.101 As regards Harriet Hale,she may have similarly \u201cbowed\u201d to her elder sister \u201cineverything\u201d  but we have a glimpse of her in a letter of Swamijiaddressed to the Hale Sisters from Swampscott dated 26 July1894102 which gives us the idea that she had a distinctivepersonality \u2014 playful and jolly. It seems that all the sisterswere vying with each other in helping Swamiji to learn French\u2014 Harriet teaching him a French song \u201cdans la plaine\u201d and indoing so perhaps playing a practical joke on her august pupil.THE HALE SISTERSSWAMI VIVEKANANDA760\u201cWhat nonsense was the song Harriet taught me, \u201cdans laplaine;\u201d Swamiji complains, \u201cI told it to a French scholar andhe laughed and laughed till the fellow as well-nigh burst at mywonderful translation. That is the way you would have taughtme French\u201d.In summing up this account of the four \u201csisters\u201d we maysay that they were extraordinary girls, whose love for Swamijiwas a sustaining factor in the high-pressure and care laden lifethat he lived in America. Speaking about this, in a letter toMary on 10 February 1895 (1896, according to Mrs. Burke),Swamiji expressed himself as follows, \u201cI am ever grateful toyou four sisters; to you I owe everything I have in thiscountry\u201d.103 On 16 March 1899 he wrote to Mary from BelurMath, \u201cWe believe in seven oceans \u2014 one of milk, one ofhoney, one of curd, one wine, one sugarcane juice, one salt,one I forget what. To you four sisters I waft my love across theocean of honey and a little wine, just to make it palatable\u201d.104On 2 March 1900, during his second visit to America, one ofthe happiest episodes of which was to meet them once again,he wrote to Mary from San Francisco, \u201cAll blessings on youand the sisters and Mother. Mary, you have been always thesweetest notes in my jarring and clashing life\u201d.105VIIAfter staying for about three weeks at Chicago (25 January-12February 1894), during most of which time he probably wasresting at the Hales\u2019 home, Swamiji arrived at Detroit(Michigan), about 238 miles from Chicago on 12 February tocarry out a lecture programme that had been arranged by theLecture Bureau. His original intention had been to stay in thecity for a week only and deliver three lectures at the Unitarian761Club - on 14, 15 and 17 February respectively. But so greatwas the demand from people who had failed to get admittanceinto his overcrowded lecture halls, that he was persuaded tostay on for a few days more during which he delivered twomore lectures and he left the city on 23 February. From themoment of his reaching the city - and to some extent evenbefore he had arrived there - he had enthusiastic admirers andfierce critics (the latter mostly Christian missionaries) and theirviews were freely expressed - often with much heat - in thepress and from the pulpits. After he left, the controversyassumed unprecedented proportions - some of the criticssmiting him on hip and thigh (as the Detroit Journal put it).The result was that Swamiji, who meanwhile had returned toChicago, was persuaded by his friends to pay a second visit toDetroit, 9 March 1894. On 11 March he delivered a lecture,The Christian Missions in India, at the local Opera Club, whichwas considered as the most eloquent lecture that he had everdelivered at the city, and was spoken of by himself as the bestlecture he had delivered so far in America. His speech of nearlytwo hours and a half was smashing rejoinder to the criticismslevelled against him, besides being full of sublime thoughts,and was highly applauded by thousands. It seemed to have hadthe effect of silencing his critics for the time - at least so far asvocal denunciation was concerned. However, another (anddespicable) form of attack on him, viz., maligning his personalcharacter by inventing scandals, at first in whispers and thenin the open, soon began, and an attempt was even made tomurder him by poisoning his coffee at a dinner party. \u201cTheywent to the length\u201d, so the Swami said, \u201cof tempting him withyoung women, promising  them recompense if theysucceeded\u201d.106 Swamiji delivered one more lecture, Buddhism,on 19 March and then proceeded to fulfil his engagement withthe Lecture Bureau by delivering two lectures at nearby BaySWAMIJI AT DETROITSWAMI VIVEKANANDA762City and Saginaw on 20 and 22 March respectively. He returnedto Detroit and delivered another lecture at the Unitarian Churchon 24 March, entitled The Women of India. He left Detroit on31 March, or thereabout and went to Chicago, where he possiblyrested for about a week and a half. He paid a third visit toDetroit two years later (1896). It may be mentioned in thisconnection that besides delivering the lectures abovementioned, Swamiji spoke many times at private parties andhad discussions with many people, newspaper reporters andothers.Detroit, the motor car capital of the world at the presentday, had not yet witnessed the birth of its automobile industry.But even at that time it was already known as the \u201cdynamiccity\u201d, being distinguished for energy and enterprise, and had apopulation of over two lacs. It was, \u201cin a sense\u201d, says Mrs.Burke, \u201ca turbulent vortex of the contemporaneous thought ofthe nation, both conservative and radical, and this fact, togetherwith the fact that Swamiji\u2019s power was rising to a peak, tendedto make his visit there akin to the explosion of a long brewingstorm\u201d. Observing some restraint in their attacks on him duringthe Parliament days at Chicago on the ground that he was thereas their guest, the Christian missionaries and other opponentsof Swamiji considered themselves as free, tooth and nail, toattack him now, and indeed considered it as their Christianduty to do so. They were greatly upset at the grand ovation hehad received, at his arrival, from the city\u2019s elite at the receptionheld in his honour at the house of his hostess, Mrs. JohnJ.Bagley. They were also infuriated at some remarks he hadmade on Christian missionaries in India at an interview with areporter  from the Detroit Free Press on the day following hisarrival. Mrs. Burke considers the Detroit period as \u201cone of the763most important in his American mission, almost equal insignificance to that of the Parliament of Religions\u201d.107Mrs. John Judson Bagley, Swamiji\u2019s hostess at Detroit,was one of the most wealthy and influential women in the city,being the widow of a former governor of Michigan. Duringher husband\u2019s governorship, she had actively helped him in allhis philanthropic work, and besides had many undertakings ofher own, such as a Sunday Bible class, a union Sunday school,and a number of charitable institutions whose object was toeducate and uplift the poor from a life of ignorance anddrudgery. At her husband\u2019s death, she was the president of theWomen\u2019s Hospital which she had helped .to found. She hadtravelled extensively all her life and, still active and energeticat 61, she was elected one of the lady managers of the ChicagoWorld\u2019s Fair. She had possibly met Swamiji at one, or more ofthe receptions organized in connection with the Parliament ofReligions and there invited Swamiji to come to Detroit and beher guest. The reception she organized in Swamiji\u2019s honour ather home was a gorgeous one, to which at least 300 of thecream of Detroit society were invited. The guests were bishops,clergymen, rabbis, professors, the mayor and his wife, whobelonged to nearly all the religious denominations of the cityand formed not only a unique intellectual gathering but aminiature Parliament of Religions. \u201cThere has not gathered ina home,\u201d wrote the Detroit Journal about it, in its issue of 15February, \u201cin Detroit in many a day and perhaps never such adistinguished assemblage of Detroiters as were present lastevening to meet the polished Hindoo monk. The reception withits dignities and formalities was entirely worthy of its reason\u201d.108It required moral courage to invite a heathen to her house as aguest - her grand-daughter, Mrs. Frances Bagley Wallace, whowas a child of nine years at the time, has said that children atSWAMIJI AT DETROITSWAMI VIVEKANANDA764the private school she attended made faces at her for the offence\u2014 and she remained one of the staunchest of Swamiji\u2019s friendsand supporters till her death. (By the way, making faces mayperhaps be ascribed to the tiny ones\u2019 jealousy at Frances\u2019 goodfortune at having Swamiji so much to herself at her home. Inthe case of their parents, at this stage, it may have been race orcolour prejudice rather than religious animosity.)As we have said above, even before Swamiji arrived atDetroit, there had been a stir among the people about theimpending visit. In its issue of 11 February 1894, the DetroitFree Press, announcing it, had referred to his success at theParliament of Religions and said, inter alia, \u201cHe showed himselfto be one of the best of orators at the Congress, speakingfaultless English without notes, and with an utterance that manyof his hearers declared would itself have been music had younot understood a word.... Naturally, his views of great questions,coming like himself from the other side of the globe, arerefreshing and stirring to the American people\u201d. That thecoming visit was viewed in a different spirit by some otherpeople is clear from the account of the interview that a reporterof the same paper (personally friendly to Swamiji) had withhim a day after his arrival, and that was published in the paperon 14 February. \u201cStrange as it may seem,\u201d wrote this reporter,\u201cthe Indian exponent of divine doctrines made many convertsin the Windy City, and he received a good deal of adulation.His personality is charming.... Upon hearing that the easternmonk was coming here, a certain lady said, `I think it is funnythat they should bring to Detroit a heathen to speak uponreligious matters. Why, he had even converted many peoplesince he came to this country!\u2019\u201d765 The bogey of a missionary of Hinduism, who had alreadymade some converts to his faith at Chicago and was out tohook others, evidently existed in the minds of some people inthe city, and Swamiji was pointedly asked by this reporter ifmissionary effort was beneath the dignity of his faith. Swamijiimmediately produced a little volume (it seems, like Gladstone,he always carried the whole Bodleian library with him in hispocket) and read out from it passages from one of Asoka\u2019sedicts, (the 12th Rock Edict) which he said was written in 200B.C. (actually the date was 257-256 B.C.). It ran as follows,\u201cIt is true that the prevalence of essential virtues differs indifferent sects, but there is a common basis. Thus, one shouldnot exalt one\u2019s sect and decry others, but tender them on everyoccasion the honour they deserve. Striving thus, one promotesthe welfare of his own sect, while serving the others. Strivingotherwise, one does not serve his own sect, while disservingothers and whosoever from attachment to his own sect andwith a view to promote it decries others, only deals rude blowsto his own sect\u201d. Swamiji went on to say that the same wiseking had forbidden war \u2014 with the result that while brutestrength advanced other nations, India fell behind. Asked ifthe combative nations of the West, where a tremendous energywas needed to develop the practical necessities of the nineteenthcentury, could adopt nonviolence, Swamiji replied, as he haddone to a similar question at Memphis, \u201cMay not one combinethe energy of the lion with the gentleness of the lamb?\u201dIn this interview, Swamiji is reported further to have said,\u201cWe never indulge in missionary work.... Nor do we sayanything against any missionaries whom you send from thiscountry anywhere.... Many come to us, but we do not strugglefor them.... With no effort from us many forms of the Hindureligion are spreading far and wide, and these manifestationsSWAMIJI AT DETROITSWAMI VIVEKANANDA766have taken the form of Christian Science, theosophy, and EdwinArnold\u2019s `Light of Asia\u2019. Our religion is older than mostreligions and the Christian creed \u2014 I do not call it a religion,because of its antagonistic features \u2014 came directly from theHindu religion. It is one of the great offshoots. The Catholicreligion also takes all its forms from us, the confessional, thebelief in saints and so on, and a Catholic priest who saw thisabsolute similarity and recognized the truth of the origin of theCatholic religion, was dethroned from his position because hedared to publish a volume explaining all that he observed andwas convinced of.\u201d Whatever one thinks of these views ofSwamiji \u2014 they have been endorsed by many scholars \u2014 onedoes not wonder, after reading them, that Christians preparedthemselves for a battle. There was a premonition of it when,even at Swamiji\u2019s reception at his arrival at Mrs. Bagley\u2019s houseand before he had uttered a word, a little of the blizzard (flyingsnowstorm) that was raging outside crept in: a lady, who wasone of the invited guests, advanced to where he was sitting andattacked and denounced him to his face.Swamiji\u2019s first lecture at the Unitarian Church, (14February 1894), was entitled \u201cManners and Customs of India\u201d,and made a great impression on the audience and theliberalminded section of the citizens but roused the fierceopposition of others, the `bluenose\u2019 Christian clergymen,specially missionaries. Mrs. Mary C. Funke, who became laterknown as one of the most devoted disciples of Swamiji, hasspoken about the meeting, which she attended, as follows. \u201cThelarge edifice was literally packed and the Swami received anovation. I can see him yet as he stepped from the platform, aregal, majestic figure, vital, forceful, dominant, and at the firstsound of the wonderful voice, a voice all music - now like theplaintive minor strain of the Eolian harp, again, deep, vibrant,767resonant - there was a hush, a stillness  that could almost befelt, and the vast audience breathed as one man\u201d.109 Anotheryoung lady who listened to this and the other lectures of Swamijiat Detroit - Miss Christine Greenstidel (later known as SisterChristine) - spoke about them as follows, \u201cWas it possible tohear this (she refers in particular to the story of the sheep lion,see above, and the moral, `Thou art that,\u2019) and ever be thesame again?\u201d110It was unfortunate that at this meeting, Swamiji wasintroduced by a Methodist Episcopalian bishop, Ninde, whowas due shortly to depart for China for missionary work. Hedid so with a fervent prayer for the day \u201cwhen people of alllands and all races may see eye to eye and be perfectly joinedtogether in the service of a common divine Redeemer,\u201dmeaning, of course, Jesus Christ. The good bishop had been sonaive as to expect that Swamiji would in his lecture entertainhim and likeminded people among the audience with narrationsof heathen customs and praise Christian missionary work inhis country in fighting them. He was horrified when Swamijispoke of Indians as the most moral nation on earth and declaredthat, though in bondage, their spirituality had endured.\u201cMissionaries,\u201d Swamiji said, \u201cwould do well to come thereand drink of the pure waters, and see what a beautiful influenceupon a great community have the lives of the multitude of goodholy men\u201d. In the course of his delineation of the character ofhis countrymen Swamiji had also said that drunkenness wasalmost unknown among them \u2014 in England one to every 400being a drunkard, and the proportion in India being one to everymillion.Swamiji\u2019s remarks on the work of the missionaries andhis assertion that they were out of place in India \u2014 no doubt aSWAMIJI AT DETROITSWAMI VIVEKANANDA768retort to the Bishop\u2019s patronizing introduction \u2014 acted as a\u2018bombshell\u2019 in Detroit, if indeed his remarks at his interviewwith the reporter of the Detroit Free Press which had beenpublished in the paper in the morning (see above) had notalready done so. In holy ire, Bishop Ninde issued an explanationthat was intended besides to placate churchmen who hadperhaps taken him to task for introducing the Swami to theaudience, and was published in the Detroit Free Press on 16February. In this statement he said that he had accepted thesuggestion that he should introduce Swamiji because, being,as he claimed, \u201cthe only person in the city to have visited India,\u201dhe had thought that it would be an appropriate act. Heemphatically contradicted Swamiji\u2019s statement on thecomparative absence of drunkenness in India and, while givinga left-handed compliment to him for being one among thosewho were doing their best to fight social evils among hiscountrymen, made a right-handed attack on Hinduism byasserting that such beneficent reforms as have recently comeabout in India had \u201csprung, not from impulses within the bodyof Hinduism but from the direct and indirect influence of thegospel of Jesus Christ\u201d. (It is interesting to note that at aboutthis time a St. Louis clergyman had made the sensationaldiscovery \u2014 announced in the Sunday Thought of 18 February1894 \u2014 that Swamiji was a graduate of Harvard Universityand was \u201cindebted to Asia only for his colour and hiscostume\u201d.)111 In an interview with the Detroit journal, BishopNinde further said, in support of his allegation of Swamiji\u2019s\u201cuntruthfulness\u201d on the drink question, \u201cWhy, it is positively afact that English liquor merchants have been sending menthroughout India for the express purpose of educating thenatives to drink intoxicating liquors, and from my observationsI should say they were very apt pupils\u201d.112769Bishop Ninde\u2019s \u201crepudiation\u201d of Swami Vivekanandaraised a protracted controversy in the press (and we maysuppose in many homes and clubs in the city), and letters andeditorials both supporting and contradicting the two personagescontinued  to be published for some time \u2014 Swamiji studiouslyholding aloof from it. Meanwhile, as we have seen above, theEvening News of 14 February had greeted Swamiji, on hisarrival at Detroit, with an editorial in which it challenged him\u2014 after taking it for granted that he claimed the superiority ofhis religion on the ability of its \u201cmahatmas\u201d to work miracles\u2014 either \u201cto put up or shut up\u201d. Though this was clearly a partof the diversionary tactics of his opponents, Swamiji made adignified statement on the subject of miracles (he had, as wehave seen already given his views about them to a representativeof the Memphis Commercial on 15 January). Swamiji\u2019s freshstatement on miracles was published in the Evening News on17 February, though its comments on it were still in the vein ofself justification rather than apology. Though for us also hereit would be a digression or a diversion, it is worthwhiledisposing of the question once and for all by quoting in fullthis statement of Swamiji. (We have already referred to Mr.O.P. Deldoc\u2019s rejoinder to the Evening News in the DetroitFree Press of 16 February.) Swamiji said, \u201cI cannot complywith the request of The News to work a miracle in proof of myreligion. In the first place, I am no miracle worker, and in thesecond place, the pure Hindu religion I profess is not based onmiracles. We do not recognize such a thing as a miracle. Thereare wonders wrought beyond our five senses, but they areoperated by some law. Our religion has nothing to do withthem. Most of the strange things which are done in India andreported in the foreign papers are sleight-of-hand tricks orhypnotic illusions. They are not the performances of the wisemen. These do not go about the country performing theirSWAMIJI AT DETROITSWAMI VIVEKANANDA770wonders in the market places for pay. They can be seen andknown only by those who seek to know the truth, and not movedby childish curiosity\u201d.113Coming back to the controversy about Bishop Ninde\u2019saccusations of Swamiji, the Michigan Christian Advocate, aweekly published at Detroit, printed the Bishop\u2019s letter to theDetroit Free Press in its issue of 24 February, with anintroduction in which it upheld the Bishop\u2019s stand. (TheHomiletic Review, in its issue of as late as November, 1894,supported the Bishop in view of what it called Swamiji\u2019scontemptuous and bitter attack on Christianity.) Earlier, threeforceful letters had been published in the Detroit Free Press of17, 18 and 20 February and signed respectively by O.P. Deldoc,a well-known writer, and persons who were anonymous (\u201cLoverof Fair Play\u201d and \u201cE. J.\u201d). Mr. Deldoc disproved Bishop Ninde\u2019sclaim that he was the only Detroiter who had visited India bystating that only a few days ago Frederick Stearns had given alecture in the city upon his travels in India and that there werescores of others who had visited \u201cthat wonderful country\u201d. Hesaid that Swamiji\u2019s remarks were indeed \u201ccaustic\u201d, as theBishop had said, but not \u201cunfriendly\u201d, as he had alleged. Hesaid also that the Bishop\u2019s statement that present-day reformsin India sprang not from impulses from within Hinduism butfrom Jesus Christ was \u201cfalse\u201d. \u201cThe fundamental morals andvirtues of Buddha, Brahma, Confucius and other moralreformers,\u201d he went on to say, \u201cwere known long before Christ\u2019scoming. Human brotherhood and the godlike in man weretaught ages before\u201d. \u201cLover of Fair Play\u201d asked why Americansshould not have one Hindu missionary among them, when theysent hundreds to India. \u201cIs not turn about fair play?\u201d heenquired. He praised Hinduism as follows, \u201cThis is a cutthroatgeneration and the gentle doctrine of the divinity of non-self is771too far in the future for us\u201d. The most effective support toSwamiji and reply to Ninde came, however, from \u201cE. J.\u201d. Hewrote, \u201cIt would have done more credit to our Christianity forthe bishop to have accepted without comment Vivekananda\u2019sassertion  that there is comparatively less drunkenness in Indiathan to have proved its falsity by admitting that a Christiannation, professing a civilization and a religion far in advanceof that of Buddha (sic), introduced that degrading vice to atemperate and religious people, and spread it broadcast therethrough insatiate love of gain. It is a more bitter reflection uponour boasted Christianity than any Vivekananda made\u201d.Swamiji\u2019s lectures at Detroit continued to be betterattended since, as Sister Christine said, \u201cThose who came tothe first lecture at the Unitarian Church came to the secondand to the third, bringing others with them. `Come\u2019, they said,`hear this wonderful man. He is like no one we have ever heard\u2019,and they came until there was no space to hold them\u201d.114 TheDetroit press in general, however, had been so intimidated bythe Bishop\u2019s denunciation of Swamiji, that reports of the secondlecture, which was entitled \u201cHindu Philosophy\u201d, and wasdelivered at the Unitarian Church on 15 February, were meagreand `cautious\u2019. The Detroit Journal said that Swamiji spokelittle on Hindu philosophy, the subject matter of his lecture,and that the whole lecture was \u201cmade up of pointed little cracksat the Christian religion\u201d. The Detroit Free Press report was onsimilar lines and accused Swamiji of making \u201ccute little jabsat the Christian religion\u201d. But the fact that the lecture was muchmore than an attack on Christianity, if it was at all such, andwas an able exposition of Hindu philosophical thought, issufficiently evident from the report that was published in theDetroit Tribune, sketchy though it was. Swamiji seems to havespoken about the philosophical ideas of the three main religionsSWAMIJI AT DETROITSWAMI VIVEKANANDA772in India (Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism), about revelation,in which, he said, all orthodox people believed, and about thespirit of toleration that prevailed among Indians from the earliesttimes. In connection  with the last-mentioned topic, he told thestory of the five blind men and the elephant (narrated by usabove).While the controversy with regard to what Swamiji hadsaid and left unsaid at his lectures and the challenge thrownout to him by the Evening News to give some miracles wasgoing on, Swamiji delivered his third lecture at the UnitarianChurch (17 February), the subject this time being The Divinityof Man. It was reported at some length in the Detroit Free Pressand the Tribune, and provided themes for the sermons of liberalministers in some churches, viz., The Gate Opening Towardsthe East by the Rev. Reed Stuart of the Unitarian Church and\u201cWhat Vivekananda Has Taught Us\u201d by Rabbi Grossman which,in their turn evoked further discussions in the press. The firsttwo paragraphs of the Free Press report are found quoted inThe Life, (page 330), and the next five paragraphs in C.W., IVunder the caption, \u201cIs India a Benighted Country?\u201d The Church,we learn from this report, was crowded almost to the doorshalf an hour before Swamiji appeared, in spite of foul weather.All professions and business occupations were represented inthe audience \u2014 lawyers, judges, clergymen, merchants, a rabbi\u2014 not to speak of women who, as we know, took the keenestinterest in everything that Swamiji said and applauded himlustily.\u201cThe lecture last night,\u201d said the reporter, \u201cwas lessdescriptive than the preceding ones, and for nearly two hoursVivekananda wove a metaphysical texture on affairs humanand divine, so logical that he made science appear like common773sense. It was a beautiful garment that he wove, replete with asmany bright colours and as attractive and pleasing tocontemplate as one of the many-hued fabrics made by hand inhis native land and scented with the most seductive fragranceof the Orient. This dusky gentleman uses poetical imagery asan artist uses  colours, and the hues are laid on just where theybelong, the result being somewhat bizarre in effect, and yethaving a peculiar fascination. Kaleidoscopic were the swiftlysucceeding logical conclusions, and the deft manipulator wasrewarded for his efforts from time to time by enthusiasticapplause\u201d. Proceeding to the lecture proper, the reporter dealtbriefly with some ideas that Swamiji had elaborated, and inparticular his view on the infinity of Self (as contrasted withthe body, which is but a shell, and the mind, which acts but abrief and sporadic part). \u201cFreedom\u201d, or \u201csalvation\u201d, the lecturerwas reported as having said, consisted in the realization of thesoul\u2019s infinity, illustrating the manner in which this realizationcame by reference to the story of the \u201csheep lion\u201d (narrated byhim earlier in a lecture at Memphis, see above) who, nurturedfrom birth among the sheep, and believing it to be and actinglike one, realized that it was a lion when it was made to see itsreflection in a clear pool of water and its resemblance to alion.All religions are good, said Swamiji, using a new imageryto bring the idea home to the minds of his listeners. \u201cA bubbleof air in a glass of water strives to join with the mass of airwithout; in oil, vinegar, and other materials of differing densityits efforts are less, or more retarded according to the liquid. Sothat soul struggles through various mediums for the attainmentof its individual infinity\u201d. (At a lecture at Memphis, see above,Swamiji seems to have first used the imagery of an air bubblestruggling to join the infinite atmosphere above. He did it thenSWAMIJI AT DETROITSWAMI VIVEKANANDA774to illustrate the individual soul\u2019s urge for uniting itself withthe universal soul. Here, by bringing in the relative densitiesof the medium through which the air bubble forces its wayupwards, he vividly illustrated the idea of all religions providingthe way to salvation, though the ways may differ.) He saidfurther that one religion is best adapted to some people, becauseof habit, association, etc., and another to others. To ask a nationabruptly to change its religion, said he, as he had said at alecture at Memphis, was to criticize a river that has been flowingfor thousands of years along a certain course, for the way it hastaken, and ask it to go back and alter it. At this lecture Swamijiis reported also to have criticized the Christian golden rule, \u2014to do unto others as you would be done by \u2014 as being \u201cahorrible, barbarous, savage creed\u201d (it is hardly probable thathe used such words). \u201cAlways self, always self\u201d, he is reportedto have said, \u201cwas the Christian creed\u201d. However he did notdesire to decry it, he is reported to have also said, for thosewho are satisfied with it to them it is well adapted.As at many other places, so here, before the lecture began,Swamiji was asked many questions \u2014 among these some wehave spoken of above, Indian mothers throwing their children,specially female ones, to the crocodiles, people killingthemselves beneath the wheels of the \u201cjuggernaut\u201d, and widowsbeing burned with their husbands. Mrs. Mary Funke tells usthat, it being announced that Swamiji would gladly answerquestions that anyone might wish to ask, a box was kept at theChurch into which people could put pieces of paper on whichthey wrote out their questions, so that Swamiji could answerthem publicly the evening following. Swamiji\u2019s replies to thesequestions on previous occasions have been given by us in theappropriate contexts, but they are worth repeating, since, atthe Unitarian Church at Detroit, his replies, being unambiguous775no less than forceful, \u2014 he mingled bitterness with pleasanthumour \u2014 seem to have been so effective that he was seldomvexed with them again during his remaining days in America.He disposed of the juggernaut legend by saying that possibly afew in their zeal to grasp the rope slipped and fell and werecrushed under the wheels, and that the incidents were laterexaggerated and  distorted so that the present legend came tobe circulated. Swamiji denied that Indians had ever burnedtheir widows, though, he said, it was true that widows hadburned themselves. In the few cases where it had occurred,said Swamiji, devoted widows were obliged first to submit tothe fiery test, that is, to put their hands into flames, and, if theyallowed them to be consumed, were allowed to have their desirefulfilled.115 India, Swamiji added, was not the only countrywhere women who loved their husbands followed immediatelythe loved ones through the realms of immortality; suicides insuch cases have occurred in every land. \u201cIt is an uncommonbit of fanaticism in any country; as unusual in India aselsewhere\u201d. \u201cNo,\u201d the speaker repeated, \u201cthe people do notburn women in India; nor have they ever burned witches\u201d.(Executions in Europe for alleged witchcraft between 1424and 1762 are believed to be over 300,000. In 1656 Anne Hibbinswas hanged as witch in Salem, Massachusetts. In 1692, in whatis known as the witchcraft delusion, at the same place, at theinstigation of preachers, 19 persons were hanged and one mankilled).116 Mrs. Funke says that Swamiji\u2019s reference to witchcraftbrought forth cheer after cheer, \u201cfor an American audienceenjoys a joke on itself\u201d. As Swamiji read the question on thecrocodiles, says Mr. Funke, for a moment, he noticeably shrank,and then with a smile of merry mischief, said, yes, his motherdid throw him to them but, as he was a fat little baby, thecrocodiles refused to swallow him.SWAMIJI AT DETROITSWAMI VIVEKANANDA776As Swamiji\u2019s lecture (The Divinity of Man) wasdelivered on a Saturday, only liberal ministers who had attendedit could comment on it in their sermons on the following day.Swamiji\u2019s opponents, who shunned his lectures and relied uponwritten reports of them, took a week to comment on them fromtheir pulpits. Thus, it was not till 25 February, when Swamijihad already left Detroit, that the storm burst. As we have saidabove,  Rev. Reed Stuart and Rabbi Grossman had, in theirsermons on 18 February, elaborated on and praised Swamiji\u2019slecture. A few hostile criticisms must also have been voiced inthe sermons of 18 February, as may be inferred from the factthat a letter from a lady who wrote under the pseudonym,\u201cJustitia\u201d, replying to them, had appeared in the Free Press of23 February. She had emphatically denied that Swamiji hadattacked the Christian religion, that is, what Jesus taught, andasserted that what he had attacked was \u201cthe outward expressionof so-called Christianity\u201d, \u2014 the few having almost all, themany scarce anything\u201d. She had asked, \u201cIs this Christianity,what Jesus meant when He said, `Love thy neighbour asthyself\u2019?\u201d She had also said that one could not wonder, if oneknew how Swamiji was treated personally, if he had some\u201ccaustic truths\u201d to say about Americans. \u201cIn Chicago,\u201d she hadobserved, \u201che was maligned and persecuted by fanatical women\u2014 American women, think of it! In this city he has been assailedwith most insulting letters in every mail. Before he evenaddressed one word to the public here, a woman, be it said toher shame, took it upon herself to attack and most unkindlydenounce him to his face in a house to which she was invitedas a guest to meet him. He has also been imposed upon andmost unjustly dealt with in the management of his lecture tourthrough his lack of knowledge of our laws and our customs tooverreach and take every mean advantage we can in business.He has been preached against in almost savage terms from777some of our orthodox pulpits by ministers who know nothingof what he has said except by the newspaper reports, which, Ithink, were inadequate and grossly misleading. How dare thesemen pronounce upon him without first hearing him! Judge notthat ye be not judged\u201d.\u201cJustitia\u2019s\u201d letter sparked off a controversy in the FreePress that went on through the whole of February. \u201cOccidental\u201ddisputed the contention that one could not properly understandwhat Swamiji had said without first hearing him and ended hisletter \u2014 after admitting that Christians have the SpanishInquisition, the Scottish Kirk, and the Salem, Mass, episodes\u2014 with reminding Swamiji\u2019s friends about the Sepoys\u2019 excessesin the \u201cMutiny\u201d. He advised them, if they wanted to serenadehim before he left the city, to secure a Scotch band to play\u201cThe Campbells are Coming\u201d which, he reminded them, wasthe first sound to greet the ears of the besieged at Lucknowand notify them that relief was at hand. Before \u201cJustitia\u201d couldreply, a letter from \u201cOne who Heard All The Lectures\u201d appearedin the paper on 26 February, supporting her contention thatone could not criticize a lecturer without hearing him personallyand justifying Swamiji on what he had said about the burningof widows in India and his retort, \u201cIn India they never did burntheir witches\u201d. He contrasted the Indian\u2019s tolerant reception ofmissionaries in their country with what Swamiji was personallyexperiencing in America, viz., abuses and robbery (byunscrupulous managers of his lecture tours). \u201cOccidental\u201dreplied that his criticisms were based on \u201cforty years of casualreading\u201d and what he had heard from a missionary\u2019s son who,born in India, knew their language and sang their songs. (Bythe way, in his childhood, the author heard some songs beingsung by Christian missionary ladies, one of them being thedaughter-in-law of one Mrs. Robertson, who had been a teacherSWAMIJI AT DETROITSWAMI VIVEKANANDA778at a school for children founded by the missionaries at whichhis mother was a pupil in her childhood. The songs fell flat onthe listeners, while the absurd pronunciations of the words ofthe songs in Indian languages and the intonations made itdifficult for them to repress laughter. Mrs. Robertson was anaffectionate lady and often visited her old pupil\u2019s house, alongwith her daughter-in-law and grandchildren. The author\u2019smother, who died on 19 August 1970, aged ninety, had a deeprespect for her). \u201cJustitia\u201d replied in a dignified letter, whichwas published in the Free Press on 26 February. \u201cIn conclusion,\u201dwrote she, \u201cI would ask the reverend brother whether he thinkssuch preaching and writing as he had indulged in exemplify agospel of love. Also, would a brass band serenading Kanandawith `The Campbells Are Coming\u2019 be Jesus\u2019 way to bring thestranger within our gates to a realizing sense of the `humanizing\u2019influence of Christianity?\u201dA present-day reader of the newspaper reports of thosedays wonders not that Swamiji was fiercely assailed by theorthodox among the Christians in America, specially themissionaries, but rather that there were so many Americans towelcome, defend and applaud him. He had become indeed the\u201csocial lion\u201d and hardly a day passed when he was notentertained at the home of some among the social andintellectual elite of the city at lunch, dinner, etc., where he wasgiven the best opportunity to discuss subjects that lay nearesthis heart. The minds of many Americans, as we have narratedin a previous chapter, were in ferment \u2014 specially as the resultof the advance of science, which threatened beliefs cherishedfor ages and was partly, if indirectly, responsible for industrialconditions under which the doctrine, \u201cevery man for himself\u201d,largely displaced older moral values. It is no wonder thatSwamiji\u2019s statements were not taken lightly by anyone and779that they were both vehemently resented and heartily approved.Generally, the liberal forces rallied round him, while thereactionary forces attacked him tooth and nail. Narrow-mindedclergymen attacked Swamiji vehemently because they foundthat their own creed was becoming more untenable every day.The American people were on the whole searching for a moreliberal and a more rational faith, and Swamiji was the verypersonification of that faith.117 It is no wonder, too, that it wasthe women of America who thronged his lecture halls \u2014 theyhad at the time, as  Mrs. Burke says, \u201ctaken over the culturallife of the nation\u201d. There was \u201cnothing effeminate, nothingweakening in the influence of women\u201d in America, as she goeson to point out, quoting Swamiji, who had said, \u201cI am almostat my wit\u2019s end to see the women of this country! They do allsorts of work \u2014 I cannot do even a sixteenth part of what theydo. . . . They are the Divine Mother incarnate\u201d.Swamiji\u2019s views were endorsed not only by women; \u2014as we have said above, men of all walks of life, who belongedmainly to the intellectual classes and, as has been said, the so-called \u201cbest people\u201d largely attended his lectures. This factwas so conspicuous that a correspondent of the Detroit FreePress even used it as a handle for a criticism of Swamiji on thescore of his being exclusive. He said that \u201cprogressive Christianministers\u2019\u2019 applauded Swamiji because they catered for thewealthy and the fashionable. He complained that while he wasasking Americans to send to his country missionaries likeFrancis Xavier, who mingled with the downtrodden people,the poor of Detroit were debarred from his lectures, becausethey had not the money to purchase tickets for his meetings.The obvious reply to this criticism is that the writer must havebeen one of those \u201cblue nosed,\u201d \u201chard-shelled\u201d, and \u201csoft-shelled\u201d clergymen who never attended any of Swamiji\u2019sSWAMIJI AT DETROITSWAMI VIVEKANANDA780lectures, for if he had done so, he would have found him to beone who saw the same in all \u2014 be they Brahmins, or Pariahs,industrialists, or wage earners, saints, or sinners. As Swamijionce (1894) wrote to Alasinga, \u201cI care more to preach religionto them (the poor) than to the high and the rich. I am nometaphysician, no philosopher, nay, no saint. But I am poor. Ilove the poor\u201d.118As we have said above, Swamiji\u2019s original programmewas to deliver three lectures in the city in the course of a week\u2019sstay there, but at the insistent demands of both those who hadheard and those who had not been able to hear him, his staywas extended till 23 February, and he delivered two morelectures. His fourth lecture was delivered in the crowded hallof the Unitarian Church on 20 February, the subject being \u201cLoveof God\u201d. The Detroit Free Press report of the lecture is to befound in full in C. W.119. The lecture was also briefly reportedin the Detroit Tribune and the Detroit Journal, the second namedpaper taking Swamiji to task for allegedly using the occasionto attack the Christian religion. However, from these reports,unfavourable as some of them were, the main ideas of Swamijistand out clearly. \u201cLove,\u201d said Swamiji, \u201cis somethingabsolutely unselfish; that which has nothing beyond theglorification and adoration of the object upon which ouraffections are bestowed. It is a quality which bows down andasks nothing in return. . . .\u201d \u201cLove\u201d, Swamiji went on to say,\u201cwas a sacrifice. It never takes, but it always gives. The Hindunever asks anything of his God, never prays for salvation and ahappy hereafter, but instead lets his whole soul go out to hisGod in an entrancing love. That beautiful state of existencecould only be gained when a person felt an overwhelming wantof God. Then God came in all of His fullness\u201d.781He referred to the Songs of Solomon and, observing thatthey were one of the most beautiful parts of the Bible, pointedout the resemblance of the sentiments expressed in them withthose expressed in the prayers of an Indian saint, presumablyMirabai, who told her husband that she was already married,and being asked by the latter, \u201cto whom?\u201d replied, \u201cto God.\u201dIn one of her prayers she says, \u201cI ask for not wealth; I ask notfor position; I ask not for salvation; place me in a hundredhells, if it be Thy wish, but let me continue to regard Thee asmy love.\u201d Swamiji said that he was pained to learn that therewas a proposal to remove the Songs from the Bible, on thealleged ground that they were not really addressed to God, butto a young woman, whom Solomon loved but who loved ayoung man and wanted to have nothing to do with Solomon.This interpretation of the songs, said Swamiji, could be acceptedonly by those who cannot understand such wondrous love forGod as is embodied in the songs. He clinched his argument byobserving that in America, where the almighty dollar isworshipped with the warmth expressed in the songs, love forGod seemed to be based upon a theory of \u201cwhat can I get outof it?\u201d Christians, he went on to say, are always wanting Godto give them something; they appear as beggars before thethrone of the Almighty. As an illustration he narrated the storyof the Emperor Akbar that, as we know, Sri Ramakrishna oftentold his disciples. A beggar applied to the emperor for almsand, asked by the latter to wait till he had finished his prayers,heard him saying, \u201cO God, give me greater wealth, power,empire, etc.\u201d. In disgust he started to leave and, on the emperorasking him why he was doing so, said, \u201cI do not beg of beggars.I would rather beg of Him before whom you are also a beggar\u201d.In conclusion Swamiji said, \u201cSome people find it difficult tounderstand the frenzy which moved the heart of Muhammad.He would grovel in the dust and writhe in agony. Holy menSWAMIJI AT DETROITSWAMI VIVEKANANDA782who have experienced such emotions have been calledepileptic. The absence of the thought of self is the essentialcharacteristic of the love for God. Religion nowadays hasbecome a mere hobby and fashion and people flock to churchlike a lot of sheep\u201d.Swamiji\u2019s fifth lecture was delivered in the afternoon of21 February 1894 at the residence of Mrs. Bagley. It was opento the public but Mrs. Bagley had also issued invitations to hernumerous friends who included lawyers, judges, ministers,army officers and businessmen with their wives and daughters.The large rooms and halls of her mansion were filled to theutmost capacity and Swamiji spoke for two hours, his subjectbeing \u201cThe Ancient Hindu Philosophers and What TheyTaught.\u201d The Detroit Journal considered it to be the mostentertaining lecture of the series, though its description of it asSwamiji\u2019s \u201cparting shot\u201d shows that the reporter had missedeverything that he had said except his observations on themissionary activities in India. The report published in theDetroit Free Press on 22 February is fuller.120 In this, too, wedo not get anything about the teachings of any other Hinduphilosopher than Sri Krishna. About Sri Krishna, Swamiji saidthat He was God incarnate on earth. He preached that He wasthe inspirer of all books and of all religions, that being why theHindus do not reject any but take them in and harmonize them.Swamiji referred to the idea of salvation by Jesus\u2019 blood andsaid that he would refuse to go to heaven by anyone\u2019s blood.The doctrine never cropped up in India, said he. Swamiji wenton to say that Sri Krishna said that whenever evil andimmorality prevailed on earth He would come down andsupport His children. This, said Swamiji, He was doing fromplace to place, so that whenever on earth was seen anextraordinary holy man who was trying to uplift humans, one783could know that He was in him. That was why Hindus neverfought any religion, or claimed that theirs was the only trueway to salvation.Religion, said Swamiji, does not depend uponknowledge. It is the soul itself, it is God, not to be attained bysimple book knowledge, or powers of speech. To be trulyreligious one has to be something more than a \u201cgreatphilosopher and greater theologian.\u201d One must be able to thinkof spirit as spirit \u2014 that needs training. \u201cThen only all doubtceases, and all crookedness of the heart is made straight. Thenall fears vanish and all doubtings are forever silent when man\u2019ssoul and God come face to face. . . . A man may be wonderfullylearned in  the Western sense yet he may not know the A.B.C.of religion. A poor Hindu sitting before an idol and trying tothink he is That, has religion. Americans think that the Hindusworship blocks of stone, but little know about the fervent natureof their souls. When Hindus hear about Americans\u2019 criticismsthey smile and say, `They are children; they may be great inphysical science; they may build huge things, but in religionthey are simply children.\u2019\u201dThe description, \u201cHis Parting Shot\u201d, that the DetroitJournal gave to this lecture of Swamiji, may have been done inview of the following which he said in concluding his speechand which we quote here in full. Said Swamiji, \u201cOne thing Imust tell you, and I do not mean any unkind criticism. Youtrain and educate and clothe and pay men to do what? To comeover to my country and abuse all my forefathers, my religion,and everything. They walk near a temple and say, `You idolaters,you will go to hell.\u2019 But they dare not do that to theMuhammadans of India; the sword would be out. But the Hinduis too mild; he smiles and passes on, and says, `Let the foolsSWAMIJI AT DETROITSWAMI VIVEKANANDA784talk.\u2019 That is the attitude. And then you who train men to abuseand criticize, if I just touch you with the least bit of criticism,with the kindest of purpose, you shriek, and cry, `Don\u2019t touchus; we are Americans. We criticize all the people in the world,curse and abuse them, say anything; but do not touch us; weare sensitive plants.\u2019 You may do whatever you please; but atthe same time I am going to tell you that we are content to liveas we are; and in one thing we are better off \u2014 we never teachour children to swallow horrible stuff, that man alone is vilewhere everything else is pure. And whatever your ministerscriticize us, let them remember this: If all India stands up andtakes all the mud that is at the bottom of the Indian Ocean andthrows it up against the Western  countries, it will not be doingan infinitesimal part of that which you are doing to us.\u201d\u201cAnd what for? Did we send one missionary to convertanybody in the world? We say to you, `Welcome to yourreligion, but allow me to have mine.\u2019 You call yours anaggressive religion. You are aggressive, but how many haveyou taken? Every sixth man in the world is a Chinese subject,a Buddhist; then there are Japan, Tibet, and Russia, and Siberia,and Burma and Siam; and, it may not be palatable, this Christianmorality, the Catholic Church, is all derived from them. Well,and how was this done? Without the shedding of one drop ofblood. With all your brags and boastings, where has yourChristianity succeeded without the sword? Show me one placein the whole world. One, I say, throughout the whole history ofthe Christian religion; I do not want two. I know how yourforefathers were converted. They had to be converted or killed;that was all. What can you do better than Mohammadanism,with all your bragging? \u2018We are the only one\u2019. And why?\u2018Because we can kill others.\u2019 The Arabs said that; they bragged.And where is the Arab now? He is the Bedouin. The Romans785used to say that, and where are they now? Blessed are thepeacemakers; they shall enjoy the earth. Such things tumbledown; it is built upon sand; it cannot remain long. Everythingthat has selfishness for its basis, competition as its right hand,and enjoyment as its goal, must die sooner or later. Such thingsmust die.\u201cLet me tell you, brethren, if you want to live, if youreally want your nation to live, go back to Christ. You are notChristians. No, as a nation you are not. Go back to Christ. Goback to him who had nowhere to lay his head. `The birds havetheir nests and the beasts their lairs, but the son of Man hasnowhere to lay his head.\u2019 Yours is religion preached in the nameof luxury. What an irony of fate! Reverse this if you want tolive, reverse this. It is all hypocrisy that I have heard in thiscountry. If this nation is going to live, let it go back to him. Youcannot serve God and Mammon at the same time. All thisprosperity, all this from Christ! Christ would have denied allsuch heresies. All prosperity which comes with Mammon istransient, is only for a moment. Real permanence is in Him. Ifyou can join these two, this wonderful prosperity with the idealof Christ, it is well. But if you cannot, better go back to himand give this up. Better be ready to live in rags with Christthan to live in palaces without him.\u201dSwamiji left Detroit on 23 February for Ada, Ohio, asmall town several hours distant by train, and delivered a lecturethere that same evening, his subject being The Divinity of Man.From the scanty report of the lecture in the Ada Record of 28February, we gather that he said very much the same things hehad elaborated in his third lecture at Detroit which was on thesame subject, e.g., that the soul is to be distinguished from themind and the body, that the Hindus do not claim that theirs isSWAMIJI AT DETROITSWAMI VIVEKANANDA786the only true religion, etc. He spoke for about half an hour, andthen, as announced beforehand, answered questions that wereasked, in the course of which he often \u201cturned the laugh on theinquirer.\u201d The questioners at Ada, however, judging from thereport, were more earnest minded than those at Detroit, fortheir enquiries related not to the crocodiles of the Ganga, towhom mothers allegedly threw their children, etc., but tostatements he had made in the lecture. In the course of an hour\u2019squestionings they received from Swamiji much additional lighton Hinduism. This portion of the report contains valuableelucidations of some philosophical ideas that he seems to havedealt with in the lecture. A few of his replies, which were terseand aphoristic, may be mentioned here. \u201cThe soul is thepermanent basis of all existence.\u201d \u201cThere was no time whenthere was no God, therefore no time when there was nocreation.\u201d \u201cGod is the creator and nature the created.\u201d \u201cThereis no resting place for the soul.\u201d \u201cReligion is the manifestationof the soul nature.\u201d \u201cWorship is feeling the holiness of God.\u201dThe reporter was not entirely fair to Swamiji for he alsosaid that he was \u201can artful dodger on many of the questions\u201d,and it is curious that he described Swamiji as very dark-skinnedand his eyes as small; and repeated without comment thehearsay that he was a graduate of an American college.However, even though the audience at Ada impresses us as abody of intelligent people who had a genuine interest in thelecture, his visit to Ada was a minor episode in his lecture tour\u2014 \u201ca side trip\u201d \u2014 arranged by the Lecture Bureau in the interestof their own purse probably. Swamiji personally must havebeen tired in body and mind during his long, busy stay at Detroit\u2014 as we shall see, he was getting sceptical about this sort oflecturing at the behest of others (`strewing pearls before theswine\u2019) \u2014 and after he had fulfilled this engagement returned787to his \u201chome\u201d at the Hales at Chicago. When he left Detroit hehad thought that he had done so for good, but it was not to be.A storm that we saw was brewing at that city even on the daythat he arrived there and was gathering intensity daily, burst inall its fury as soon as he had left it. His parting lecture (someportions of which we have quoted extensively) was the laststraw for the patience of his opponents, and not only Swamijibut his supporters at the city were subjected to almost dailyattacks in the press, the pulpit, public meetings, andconferences. In view of this, Swamiji forgot his urgent needfor rest and, as advised by his friends, returned to the arena forpicking up the gauntlet that had been thrown down at him byhis opponents.A brief account of the \u201cChristian onslaught\u201d on Swamijiduring his absence (23 February to 9 March 1894) will suffice,\u2014 it is not an edifying story and we have already had someidea of the lines of attack that his opponents adopted. A Baptistclergyman criticized Swamiji for his views on the Christianway of praying to God (for gifts) by saying that Hindus do notpray like the Christians because their God, Brahma, beingwithout attributes, has no ears! On the first Sunday followingSwamiji\u2019s departure (that is, 26 February) the Rev. Mr. Newmanof the Central Christian Church said in his sermon that whatSwamiji had been representing was himself, neither Hinduismnor India, and he himself supplied the lacunae by his ownversion of Hindu customs which, it goes without saying, was agross misrepresentation. On the same day the Detroit Tribunepublished a report of a Sunday sermon by one Rev. Moray ofYpsilanti, a city in Michigan near Detroit. He accused Swamijiand his supporters (of whom he named two, viz., RabbiGrossman and Rev. Stuart) of telling only \u201chalf-truths\u201d, \u201cwhichmay sometimes do the work of lies and slanders.\u201d As an instanceSWAMIJI AT DETROITSWAMI VIVEKANANDA788he quoted Rabbi Grossman and Rev. Stuart as saying that therewas as much immorality in America as in India, if not more.This was a half-truth, said he, since immortality existed inAmerica in spite of Christianity but in India it did so becauseof Hinduism, its precept and the example of its gods. He alsoreferred to Swami Vivekananda\u2019s denial that Indian widowshad ever been burned on the funeral pyres of their husbandsexcept in rare and exceptional cases. If such \u201chorrible rites\u201d(upon which he spoke at length) no longer existed, it was so,he said, due to the influence, direct or indirect, of the Christianmissions, which were thus proved to be necessities in India.To these hysterics of the clergy a reply appeared in aneditorial which ran in two papers, the Detroit Tribune and theSunday News Tribune of 3 March 1894. It expressed surpriseat the fact that simply because one benighted Hindu had stoodup and in good queen\u2019s English given some reasons to believethat his faith had not been judged fairly by Christianmissionaries in his country, all the learned divines of the cityshould think it necessary \u201cto pound the dust all out of theirpulpit cushions in declaiming against\u201d him. \u201cIt ought to besafe,\u201d the editorial argued, \u201cfor Christians, who know whatthey believe and why they believe it, to hear Vivekananda, oranybody else. If they carry their faith around on a platter and itis liable to slip off at the least joggle, it is high time for it to bejoggled.\u201d \u201cMost men,\u201d the writer explained, \u201ccarry their brainsaround with them all through the week, and they can be trustedto cling to the doctrines they understand and believe. It is vainand foolish to smother discussion.\u201d The editorial ended withthe following tribute to Swamiji\u2019s work. \u201cA late revered andadmired bishop in Michigan said in connection with his readingof books on oriental themes that the time had come when789religion must be studied comparatively. Vivekananda has helpedus in such a study.\u201dGood counsels such as the above had, however, longceased to have any influence on the minds of the orthodoxclergy, whose mood had reached the state of frenzy since itwas becoming clearer to them that the heathen was drawing tohis meetings an ever-increasing number of their flock. If didnot matter to them that Swami Vivekananda claimed that hehad the greatest respect for the founder of the Christian religion,that he was not on a proselytizing mission and that he onlydesired that the Christian should be a better Christian, as hewanted that the Hindu should be a better Hindu, the Buddhista better Buddhist and so on. Clinging fanatically to their beliefthat Christianity was the only true religion on earth, they hadno patience with the advocates of the science of comparativereligions, especially when they knew that, as Mrs. Burke putsit, \u201ctheirs was a creed from which the age was moving away\u201d.We have seen that even  before the Parliament of Religionshad met, voices had been raised against it on the ground thatthe idea behind it was a tacit recognition of the equality of allreligions. Since then many clergymen had come out with opendenunciation of the Parliament. For instance, the Rev. Mr.Sullivan of Memphis, had declared in a sermon delivered on23 January 1894 that the \u201cParliament was the greatest fraud ofthe nineteenth century\u201d. The father of the poetess, Mrs. CharlesErskine Scott Wood \u2014 better known as Sarah Bard Field \u2014expressed his grudge against the publicity being given toSwamiji by appearing before the members of his householdone morning at the breakfast table with a towel wrapped turbanwise around his head and sonorous syllables in imitation ofSanskrit in caricature of Swamiji.121 Attacks on Swamiji nowbecame more determined than ever before and his enemiesSWAMIJI AT DETROITSWAMI VIVEKANANDA790now acted in concert to oppose him by every means, fair orfoul, carrying their campaign against him also to India.To make a long story short, on 5 March 1894, the Baptistsof Detroit held a mass meeting, at which several reverendgentlemen indulged in an unbridled denunciation of Hinduism.One Dr. Boggs characterized India as \u201cthe most idolatrous landon the face of the earth,\u201d the caste system as \u201cone of themasterpieces of Satan\u201d, and concluded with declaring, \u201cThereis no saviour in Hinduism. Christ alone can save India\u201d. Acertain Dr. Gordon said, \u201cI never believed in parliaments ofreligions. . . . All religions except that which treats of the oneChrist are bogus. We must still send out missionaries and havean abundance of faith\u201d. Others put on display their oldwarhorses, Christian missionaries who had worked for manyyears in India, and who now led the charge against India, whichthey averred they loved and had served. Two days after theBaptists\u2019 performance, the Missionary Society of the Fort StreetPresbyterian Church held their annual meeting  and a vintageclergyman, one Dr. Thackwell, who had served for 45 years inIndia, drew a gruesome picture of Indian society \u2014 widowsbeing stripped of their finery and jewels and, made to put oncoarse garments, becoming the Cinderella of the family, femalebabies being strangled to death, sometimes by their ownmothers, the Hindus in general looking upon God as thirsty forhuman blood \u2014 and praising the British government forattempting to stop the evil practices while the Indianintelligentsia were absolutely indifferent.Americans, however, no longer gulped down such horrorstories \u2014 the speeches made by the oriental delegates, notablySwamiji, at the Parliament of Religions and the latter\u2019s lectureson the manners and customs of India during his lecture tours791having made them somewhat better informed and wary. On 15March 1894, the Detroit Journal published a letter from oneMr. H. Steele, challenging Dr. Thackwell\u2019s statements, exposingthe methods used by the missionaries to raise funds for theirwork, and ridiculing the statement that the British governmenthad abolished the custom of Sati. As regards the crocodiles towhom Hindu mothers threw their children, Mr. Steele quotedSwamiji as one who was born on the banks of the Ganga assaying that there were no crocodiles in that river. The story ofIndian mothers strangling their own female children might beequally without a foundation, he said. As regards the assertionthat the British government had abolished Sati, he said, if true,\u201cit must have been because they could make no money out ofit\u201d.122 Mr. Steele was better informed on missionary methodsfor raising money. He cited a Boston clergyman \u2014 a certainDr. Gordon \u2014 for giving the following information about it.\u201cThey pray every day for a month and then take up a $ 20,000collection. He boasts that by this means they get from poorservant girls $ 50, and from one poor lady living on a treatmenthouse, who only had a thousand dollars to live on all the rest ofher days, they managed to get $ 800.\u201dAn ominous indication of the determination of themissionaries to carry on their work despite recent exposures ofits true nature and methods, was the holding of the secondinternational convention of the Student Volunteer MissionaryMovement in Detroit. This occurred shortly after Swamiji hadleft the city and before he returned, viz., from 28 February to 4March 1894. About 1200 young men and women, representingabout 300 educational institutions, all said to be turning forwardtoward the foreign mission field for their work, attended it. Itwas as much an answer to the Parliament of Religions as itwas to Swamiji. In its editorial article of 10 March, theSWAMIJI AT DETROITSWAMI VIVEKANANDA792Michigan Christian Advocate gloated upon the achievementas follows: \u201cWhat a splendid antidote the convention was forVivekananda and his lectures! Came just in the nick of time.The glamour produced by his suave sophistries vanished likemist before the stalwart faith and living experience of menwho have met and coped with heathenism on its own ground.Vale Kananda!\u201d We are told that the meetings were crowdedto the fullest with missionaries and others and that the Christianpeople of Detroit came forward suitably to take care of thedelegates and provide entertainments for them.A redeeming feature of the demonstration by themissionaries was the prominence given in the speeches to thespiritual rather than the secular aspect of missionary work,which was summed up in one of their slogans, \u201cLet us advanceupon our knees\u201d. This, one may think, was an antidote to theantidote to Swamiji that the Christian Advocate thought thedemonstration was. The latter was further counteracted by thepublication in the Evening News of 1 March 1894 (while themeetings were going on) of a long, illustrated article thatglaringly exposed  the lies about India contained in works likeCaleb Wright\u2019s \u201cIndia and its Inhabitants\u201d that was publishedin the 1850\u2019s and formed the mental framework of the averageAmerican on things Indian since then. In the concluding portionof its editorial on the subject, the Evening News quoted from awork written by an American missionary, named Rev. A.D.Rowe, who said that books like Caleb Wright\u2019s were intendedto astonish rather than instruct their readers, and that they saidlittle or nothing about the hopes and fears, joys and sorrows,sympathies and ambitions which are common to all mankind,including Indians. \u201cThe school children of America,\u201d said Rev.Rowe, \u201cknow more about the burning of widows and thedrowning of infants in India than do the fathers of an Indian793village\u201d. He also mentioned a story that he had heard from acaptain of a P & O steamer about an American tourist on boardhis ship, who was very disappointed and angry to learn that hecould not see a widow being burned, or a pilgrim crushed bythe car of juggernaut, and said that all the poetry of the easthad gone and he wished that he had never left home. (Thisreminds one about the story that the redoubtable Tsar of all theRussians, Peter the Great, who, when on a visit to the PrussianCourt, requested that he be shown a person being broken onthe wheel and was angry when they could not oblige him witha demonstration on the ground that at the moment they hadnone who had been condemned to be so dealt with.)The wordy duel between Swamiji\u2019s opponents and hissupporters continued to be carried on in the columns ofnewspapers even after Swamiji had returned to Detroit on 9March 1894. Our good friends, O.P. Deldoc and Occidental,returned to the arena and, as before, wrote respectivelywelcoming and denouncing Swamiji. Mr. Deldoc (whateverwas his real name, this was obviously a penname) concludedhis letter to the Detroit Critic  of March, 1894 with the followingwords, \u201cWe hopefully turn with anxious eyes to the Orient, orto the `wise men of the east\u2019 where the Star of Bethlehem arose,and where God\u2019s bright sunlight ever dawns. If you have apurer religion than we, and surely you can have none practicallyworse, I beseech you come over and help us\u201d. Occidentalconcluded his epistle, which was published in the Free Pressof 12 March, thus, \u201cHorror of horrors! Wholesale infanticide,cobras, crocodiles, and willful falsehood? Does the witches\u2019cauldron in Macbeth equal this? . . . `False in one thing,therefore false in all\u2019. Therefore, unless you have confirmatoryevidence from other sources, please take all Kananda\u2019sstatements cum grano salis (with a grain of salt); and for theSWAMIJI AT DETROITSWAMI VIVEKANANDA794love of heaven, let us have the plain truth\u201d. (He arraignedSwamiji of being false in all his statements because he thoughthe had definitely proved his falsity in one respect, viz., hisstatement about the crocodiles. This claim was based on whata man who had been an officer of a vessel some years ago hadtold him. This ex-captain of a vessel had told him that once hehad been obliged to have his moorings cleared at the mouth ofthe Hoogley river of the floating bodies of infants. As the mouthof the Hoogley swarmed with crocodiles, the conclusion drawnwas that these infants had been thrown by their mothers asofferings to the crocodiles into the Hoogley at Calcutta, whichwas thirty miles upstream.123)Swamiji arrived at Detroit on 9 March 1894 and thistime put up at the residence of the Hon. T. W. Palmer as hisguest. Mr. Palmer was a wealthy and influential citizen ofDetroit and had a long record of service to the State and CentralGovernments. He was the president of the Chicago World\u2019sColumbian Exposition and it was probably there that he hadcome to know and love Swamiji. Swamiji wrote about him tothe Hale Sisters on 12 March 1894 as follows: \u201cI am now livingwith Mr. Palmer. He is a very nice gentleman,\u201d124 and again,on 15 March,125 as follows, \u201cI am pulling on well with oldPalmer. He is a very jolly good old man. . . . Mr. Palmer makesme laugh the whole day\u201d. As Mrs. Bagley was getting restiveat Swamiji staying for many days with Mr. Palmer, hereluctantly came away to the former\u2019s residence once again tobe her guest. He wrote to Isabelle McKindley on 18 March, \u201cIhave returned today to Mrs. Bagley\u2019s as she was sorry that Iwould remain so long with Mr. Palmer. Of course, in Palmer\u2019shouse there was real `good time.\u2019 He is a real, jovial, heartwhole fellow and likes `good time\u2019 a little too much with his`hot Scotch\u2019. But he is right along innocent and childlike in his795simplicity. He was very sorry that I came away but I could nothelp\u2019\u2019. Comparing his two hosts at Detroit with each other,Swamiji wrote to Mary Hale on 30 March, \u201cMrs. Bagley is avery spiritual lady, and Mr. Palmer a spirituous gentleman butvery good.\u201d126In view of the open hostility of the orthodox clergy andtheir flock, as evidenced by the controversy that was beingcarried on in the press and the holding of the meeting of theStudent Volunteer Missionary Movement, at which moreintemperate speeches may have been delivered than there isrecord of, it was, one should think, well advised of Swamijithat this time he stayed for some days after arrival at Detroitwith Mr. Palmer. Besides vilifying him in the worst possiblemanner, viz., inventing scandals, they attempted evenassassination by mixing poison in his coffee in a dinner. Thefollowing statement that Swamiji once made after his return toIndia perhaps referred also to this period. \u201cIt struck me morethan once,\u201d said he, \u201cthat I should have to leave my bones onforeign shores on account of the prevalence of religiousintolerance\u201d.127 Ingersoll had told him, \u201cFifty years ago youwould have been hanged in this country if you had come topreach. You would have been  burned alive, or you would havebeen stoned out of the villages\u201d. In Mr. Palmer\u2019s house he hadsecurity as well as good company, for the old man, in spite ofsome failings, was exceptionally broadminded in religiousmatters. He helped Swamiji in various ways. He gave elaboratedinners at his residence which were attended by persons of thehighest standing, with a view to introducing Swamiji to them,and where Swamiji impressed all by his interesting andinstructive conversation.SWAMIJI AT DETROITSWAMI VIVEKANANDA796Mr. Palmer had a group of intimate friends, who wereall above sixty years of age and which he called his \u201cOld Boys\u2019Club\u201d.128 They attended these parties and gave dinners whereSwamiji was the chief guest. Mr. Palmer introduced Swamijito his audience at the Opera House with a nice little speechfull of good humour and noble sentiments, as we shall seepresently. For his crime of befriending Swamiji, the fanaticsattacked Mr. Palmer with false accusations, as we learn fromSwamiji\u2019s letter to the Hale Sisters dated 15 March. SaidSwamiji, \u201cThe funniest thing said about me here was in one ofthe papers which said, `The cyclonic Hindu has come and is aguest with Mr. Palmer. Mr. Palmer has become a Hindu and isgoing to India; only he insists that two reforms should be carriedout: firstly that the Car of Jagannath should be drawn byPercherons raised in Mr. Palmer\u2019s Loghouse Farm, andsecondly that the Jersey cow be admitted into the Pantheon ofHindu sacred cows\u2019. Mr. Palmer is passionately fond of bothPercheron horse and Jersey cow and has a great stock of bothin his Loghouse Farm\u201d.129 Mr. Palmer and some of his friendshelped Swamiji with contributions towards the fund which hewas raising in aid of his project in India \u2014 thus also counteringthe propaganda that he was out on a proselytizing mission. (Itis not known whether Mr. Palmer made a contribution, but oneof his friends, Mr. Freer, donated two hundred dollars.)Swami Vivekananda\u2019s first lecture at Detroit during thisvisit of his was delivered on Sunday, 11 March 1894, at thelocal Opera House before a very large audience. The subject,\u201cThe Christian Missions in India,\u201d was suggested (accordingto the Detroit Journal) by the convention of the studentvolunteers that was held in the preceding week, and his lecturewas expected to be, and actually was, a \u201cfinishing blow\u201d to hisopponents. Swamiji spoke for about two hours and a half, during797which he was listened to by his audience in spellbound silencethat was broken now and then by loud applause. It wasacknowledged in the press as the best address he had so fardelivered in the city, and Swamiji wrote about it to Mary Halethat it was the best address he had ever delivered. The DetroitFree Press report of this lecture minus the first two paragraphsand the headlines is to be found in C.W., VIII, 214_19, underthe caption \u201cChristianity in India\u201d. In its issue of 12 March1894, the Evening News commented editorially on it underthe caption, \u201cA Pointer for the Missionaries\u201d. About a monthlater \u2014 on the eve of Swamiji\u2019s visit to Boston \u2014 a large portionof it was reprinted by the Boston Evening Transcript of 5 April1894. From this it found its way into C.W., IV, 198_202, underthe caption, \u201cIs India a benighted Country?\u201d. A fairly goodsummary of Swamiji\u2019s lecture was published in the Journal ofthe Mahabodhi Society of Calcutta, and this was reproducedin the Indian Mirror, Calcutta, on 8 June 1894.130As said above, Swamiji was introduced by Mr. Palmer,who recited a fable, by way of a preface, that deserves quotationhere in full, since it proves that theologians may quarrel, butthe common folk in all countries have a better understandingof fundamental truth than is generally believed. Said Mr.Palmer, \u201cTwo knights of honour once met on the field, andseeing a shield hanging on a tree they halted. One said, `Whata very  fine silver shield\u2019. The other replied that it was notsilver but copper. Each disputed the other\u2019s statement until atlast they got off their horses, tied them to the tree, and drawingtheir swords fought for several hours. After they were bothwell spent by the loss of blood they staggered against eachother and fell on the opposite sides from where they had beenfighting. The one glanced up at the pendant shield, and said,`You were right, my friend. The shield is copper\u2019. The otherSWAMIJI AT DETROITSWAMI VIVEKANANDA798stood up and said, `It is I who was mistaken. The shield issilver.\u2019 If they had looked at both sides of the shield in the firstplace it would have saved the loss of much blood. I think thatif we looked at both sides of every question there would beless argument and fighting\u201d.As we can gather from the newspaper reports of hislecture, Swamiji began it with giving an idea of what Indiawas like before he dealt with the main subject, viz., the Christianmissions in India. Then, tracing the history of Christian missionsin India, he said that, as contrasted with the first invaders ofIndia, viz., the Aryans who did not seek to exterminate thenatives but elevated them, the first Christian missionaries, viz.,the Spaniards and the Portuguese, killed many people andconverted some, being under the idea that their God hadcommanded them to do so. The Spaniards, who were the firstto come, landed in Ceylon and, finding a temple in which atooth relic of Buddha was preserved, destroyed the temple andthrew the relic into the sea. (Actually, it was not a tooth ofBuddha but a fake manufactured by the priests and was a footlong, said Swamiji amidst laughter.) With that feat the Spaniardsstopped their missionary efforts in the East. The Portuguese,who came next, landed in Western India, and finding there atemple built in the form of a body with three heads thatrepresented the Trinity and believing it to be of the devil broughttheir cannon to bear  upon it and destroyed it. They then killedmany people, and converted some \u2014 90% of the latter acceptingChristianity to save their lives.The missionary efforts after the British occupation ofthe country were not more successful, Swamiji proceeded toshow. The East India Company kept the missionaries away.\u201cThe Hindus were the first to welcome the missionaries, not799the Englishmen who were engaged in trade\u201d. The earlymissionaries were true servants of Jesus and were gentle, kindlymen. One of them, Dr. Long, translated a drama in Bengaliinto English (the Nildarpan) which described the misdeeds ofthe European indigo planters (actually, as we now know, thedrama was translated by the great Bengali poet, MichaelMadhusudan Datta), and was sentenced to a term ofimprisonment by the government. As the British hold of thecountry became stronger, the missionary enterprise began tobecome stagnant, a condition that characterized missionaryefforts in India currently. Missionaries of the type of Long havepassed away, the Suez Canal opening up a number of evils.Swamiji described at considerable length the type of men whocame to India in his times as missionaries, the life they led,how they sought converts to their faith, and the futility of suchefforts. They knew nothing about the people, did not know aword of Sanskrit in which the religious thoughts of the peopleare enshrined and, being married men and anxious that theirwives should have company, lived in the white colonies,identified themselves with the interests of the English residentsand, in doing so, directly antagonized the interests of the nativesand made it impossible to get in touch with them. They wereincompetent men, and money was being uselessly spent onthem, he said.As regards the methods by which the missionariessecured converts, Swamiji gave a graphic picture of the starvingconditions of the people, especially during famines, and howthe missionaries exploited them in their own interests. Theybrought some money with them and founded some good schoolsand colleges where, however, there were no conversions, since\u201cthe Hindu boy was very clever \u2014 he took the bait but nevergot the hook\u201d. Those who were converted, Swamiji said, wereSWAMIJI AT DETROITSWAMI VIVEKANANDA800the few who made a sort of a living by hanging round themissionaries. \u201cWe sometimes have famines in India,\u201d Swamijiwent on to say. \u201cAnd so the young missionaries will hang aboutthe fag end of a famine and give a starving native 5 shillings,and there you have him, a readymade Christian; take him. Thatwas probably a baptist missionary, and so when a Methodistmissionary comes along he gives the same native 5 shillings,and his name is again registered as a convert\u201d. He would beglad, he said, if they made Christians by giving bread and workto the people. India, said he, requires help from Christ, but notfrom the antichrist; these men are not Christ like. They weremarried, and came over and settled down comfortably and madea fair livelihood.After he had exposed the character and futility ofmissionary activity in India, Swamiji dwelt on the danger thatits continuance might threaten humanity with. \u201cIf there werenot different religions, no religion would survive,\u201d said he,since, if the whole universe should come to have the sametemperament, physical or mental, destruction wouldimmediately result. \u201cWhy could you not convert the Jew? Whycould you not make the Persians Christians? Why is it that toevery African, who becomes a Christian 100 become followersof Muhammad? Why can\u2019t you make an impression upon Chinaand Japan? Because oneness of mental temperament all overthe world would be death. Nature is too wise to allow suchthings\u201d. He decried proselytization by violence, pointing outthat while Muhammadans who used the greatest violencenumber the least of the three great missionary faiths  of theworld, the Buddhists, who never used the sword, number thehighest among them. \u201cThe Christian nations,\u201d Swamiji wenton to say, \u201chave filled the world with blood and tyranny,\u201d and801asked, \u201cWhat Christian voice goes through the land againstsuch horrors?\u201dIn his inimitable language, using metaphor after metaphorto bring his points home to his listeners, Swamiji gave themhis thoughts on the essentials of religion to deduce therefromthe lessons of universal tolerance. In every religion, said he,there is the essential truth and the nonessential casket in whichthis jewel lies. \u201cThe shell of the oyster is not attractive, but thepearl is within it\u201d. He drew a beautiful simile to illustrate thispoint. He described how a savage might find a few jewels and,prizing them, tie them with a rude thong and string them abouthis neck. As he became slightly civilized he would perhapsexchange the thong for a string. Becoming still moreenlightened he would fasten his jewels with a silken cord andwhen possessed of a high civilization he would make anelaborate gold setting for his treasures. But throughout all thechanges in settings the jewels \u2014 the essentials \u2014 would remainthe same. Using another metaphor he made the followingappeal: \u201cWhy take a single instrument from the great religiousorchestra of the earth? Let the great symphony go on\u201d.Swamiji had some hard words to say of Americans \u2014uttered though they were in love and a spirit of humility. \u201cWhereis the spirituality one would expect in a country which is soboastful of its civilization? I have not found it. `Here\u2019 and`hereafter\u2019 are words to frighten children. It is all `here\u2019. Tolive and move in God \u2014 even here, even in this body! All selfshould go out; all superstition should be banished. Such menlive in India. Where are such in this country? Your speakerspreach against `dreamers\u2019. The people of this country wouldbe better off if  there were more `dreamers\u2019. If a man herefollowed literally the instructions of his Lord he would be calledSWAMIJI AT DETROITSWAMI VIVEKANANDA802a fanatic. There is a good deal of difference between dreamingand the brag of the nineteenth century. The bees look for theflowers. Open the lotus! The whole world is full of God andnot sin. Let us help each other. Let us love each other. A beautifulprayer of the Buddhist is: `I bow down to all the saints; I bowdown to all the prophets; I bow down to all holy men and womenall over the world.\u2019\u201dSwamiji\u2019s lecture at the Opera House seemed to havesilenced his critics, at least for the time being, and on thefollowing Sunday those who had engaged themselves inpounding the dust of their pulpits every time he delivered alecture on the occasion of his first visit to the city, refrainedfrom doing so. A brief letter from an anonymous missionaryappeared in the Detroit Free Press of 17 March, criticizingSwamiji\u2019s accusation that missionaries in India had noknowledge of Sanskrit, and his statement that there were nocrocodiles in the Ganga. He said that missionaries did not learnSanskrit because it was a dead language, and that they spenttheir time on the spoken languages. He mockingly asked \u201cthelearned Babu\u201d what, if they were not crocodiles, were thecreatures that are to be seen sunning themselves on the sandchurs in every large river of India, and whether they could beVishnu with his 16 wives and 16000 concubines and all theprogeny that he had murdered disporting themselves under thisguise. There was no reply to this savage attack on Hinduismthrough the Free Press columns, but our good friend, Mr. O. P.Deldoc, sent a rejoinder to the Detroit Critic, which waspublished in that paper on 18 March 1894. He dwelt on thereligious bigotry that prevailed in the United States, referringin particular to the blue laws of Connecticut, and laws withregard to licentiousness, women  and prohibition \u2014 and803drawing therefrom the obvious conclusion that it did notbehoove them to cast stones across the sea.On 21 March 1894 a certain Rev. R. A. Hume wrote anopen letter to Swamiji from outside Detroit, expressing surpriseat many things he was reported as having said in his lectures.He was the same gentleman who had said in the Parliament ofReligions, \u201cIn a generation all the positions of influence andresponsibility will be in the hands of the Christian communityin India\u201d. He asked for Swamiji permission to print this letterof his and any reply that Swamiji might give \u2014 the objectbeing to draw Swamiji into a public controversy. Swamijisensed it but, obviously touched by the manner of his addressinghim, viz., as \u201cMy Fellow countryman from India\u201d (he was bornin India, and had spent most of his life there, he had said), gavea brief reply. Hume sent a second letter to him, to whichSwamiji, now awake to his real purpose, did not reply. Soonafterwards Swamiji came to know that Hume was secretlyapproaching some of his friends and asking them not to helphim in any manner.131 It was not really necessary for him totake further note of Hume\u2019s criticism for the controversy wascarried on by others. The Hume Vivekananda letters set off abitter debate which lasted into the early part of 1895 and whichreceived a wide publicity as it was published in a number ofperiodicals such as the Forum, the Arena the Monist, etc. Allconceivable aspects of the subject were discussed threadbareuntil, when it was closed, everybody who had given his time toreading it felt that he had gained precious little by doing so.We refrain from going into the details of this fruitlesscontroversy, for a reader of these pages is likely similarly tofind that his time is thereby wasted \u2014 every accusation andreply having already appeared many times in previous debatesSWAMIJI AT DETROITSWAMI VIVEKANANDA804concerning Swamiji\u2019s  many lectures in America and dealt withby us in appropriate places.The almost complete silence that the orthodox clergyand the missionaries maintained at least for some time afterSwamiji had delivered his lecture did not really mean that theyhad been won over to his ideal of universal brotherhood andtoleration. Mrs. Burke ascribes the silence partly to \u201cthetremendous \u2014 one may almost say, supernatural \u2014 power hewas able to exert when he so wished\u201d. Whatever one may thinkof that, as Mrs. Burke herself points out, there was still a lot ofpropaganda being carried on against him, although the centreof the missionaries\u2019 propaganda was now India rather thanAmerica. In America, the propaganda now assumed its vilestform \u2014 a widespread whispering campaign in an effort tobesmirch Swamiji\u2019s personal character by inventing scandalsof what Romain Rolland calls the characteristic Anglo-Saxontype, viz., charge of seduction. In this campaign, one is ashamedto say, some sectarian leaders in India, including Pratap ChandraMajumdar, blinded by jealousy of Swamiji\u2019s success, acted asaiders and abettors. A writer of biography of Swamiji cannotomit an account of it, however he may dislike the task, and weshall deal with it, albeit as briefly as possible, in a subsequentChapter.Swamiji\u2019s next lecture at Detroit was not delivered tillabout eight days later, on 19 March 1894, the subject being\u201cBuddhism, the Religion of the Light of Asia\u201d, and the placethe Auditorium. Beginning his lecture with a review of theearly religions of India, Swamiji described the conditions atBuddha\u2019s birth, the story of his life, and his teachings. Thelecture had been advertised as his \u201cfinal lecture\u201d which he hadno doubt intended it to be, since, as had probably already been805arranged by the Lecture Bureau from which he had just got hisrelease, he was scheduled to deliver lectures at Bay City andSaginaw,  two small cities near Detroit on 20 and 22 Marchrespectively. His enemies at Detroit had evidently done somebrisk work before he had arrived at Bay City and as a result hewas refused a roof by the local clergy, who also cautioned theirflocks to stay away from his lectures. Nevertheless, his comingwas announced in the local press with enthusiasm, and areporter of the Bay City Daily Tribune, who met him soonafter his arrival, gave an account of the lecture, which was on\u201cHinduism\u201d and delivered at the Opera House and waspublished in that paper in its issue of 21 March. It gives us afair idea of what he spoke, together with a glowing descriptionof the appearance and personality of the speaker. \u201cKananda isstriking in appearance,\u201d said this reporter. \u201cHe is nearly sixfeet tall, must weigh 180 pounds, and is splendidlyproportioned\u201d. (A reporter of the Baltimore American, whomet him only about seven months later, on 12 October 1894,thought that he weighed about 225 pounds.)132 \u201cHe has,\u201d theBay City reporter went to say, \u201ca clear olive complexion andbeautiful black hair and eyes and clean shaven face. His voiceis soft and well-modulated, and he speaks English remarkablywell; in fact better than the majority of Americans. He is politeto a noticeable degree\u201d.From the reports, the speech appears to have been afighting one \u2014 in the style of the Detroit address \u2014 and showsthat he had not been \u2014 as indeed he could never be \u2014browbeaten by his enemies to say only soft words that mightflatter an audience. He criticized the Biblical theory of creation,and rejected the belief in a God that is angry and punishes manfor his sins. He said that the Hindus have no theory ofredemption in their religion. He asserted that the entire systemSWAMIJI AT DETROITSWAMI VIVEKANANDA806of the Roman Catholic Church had been taken from theBuddhists. He criticized the Christian missionaries, the zeal ofthe Presbyterian church and its non-toleration, the dollarworshipping in America, and the press.  The lecture wasreported favourably \u2018in the papers, as was the one, \u201cTheHarmony of Religions\u201d, that he delivered at Saginaw on thefollowing day, though the audience at the latter place was muchsmaller than at the former place. In the lecture at SaginawSwamiji spoke very much the same things as he had said in hislectures at Detroit, and the Saginaw Evening News report of itlooks mostly like a collection of extracts from the Detroit pressreports of his lectures on 11 and 19 March, which we havequoted from in extenso above, and need not repeat here.In accordance with a promise he had given to his friendsat Detroit that after his engagements at Bay City and Saginawwere finished he would pay them one more visit, Swamijireturned to Detroit on 23 March and delivered one more lecturethere on the following day. The subject was \u201cThe Women ofIndia\u201d. In many of his lectures and talks Swamiji had spokenabout the condition of the women in India, highly praising theideals of Indian womanhood and contrasting them with thoseof the women of the West. It goes without saying that the portraitthat he drew of Indian women differed from what the averageAmerican had formed about them, relying as he did on thereports of the missionaries. His views on the condition of thewomen in India were challenged by the missionaries and, asthe reader will remember, a lecture that he had delivered beforea Ladies\u2019 club at Boston in the pre-parliament days on thecondition of the Indian women, and specially widows, hadearned him the displeasure of the patrons of the local RamabaiCircle. The reports that appeared of this Detroit lecture in thelocal papers are brief, but about a week later an article appeared807in the Tribune, which purported to be based on notes that somelady listeners had taken of what he had said from time to timein private conversations on the subject. It gives us (as it gavethe Detroit public then) a better idea of Swamiji\u2019s views on thesubject. (It may be mentioned here that a lecture that Swamijidelivered at the Shakespeare Club House in Pasadena,California, during his second visit to America, on 18 January1900, was on the same subject, and dealt with it moreextensively. It is to be found in C.W. and helps us to guesswhat he had said at Detroit in private talks and his lecture atDetroit at this time.)133Swamiji seems to have begun his lecture with a narrationof the place of honour that women occupied in ancient India,citing as an evidence the fact that some of the Vedic Rishiswere women. It was unfair, said he, to judge women in the eastby the western standard. \u201cIn the west woman is the wife; in theeast she is the mother\u201d. (In the Pasadena lecture Swamiji said,\u201cThe ideal of womanhood in India is motherhood \u2014 thatmarvellous, unselfish, all suffering, ever forgiving mother. Thewife walks behind \u2014 the shadow\u201d.) He stated that in India thewomen was the visible manifestation of God and that her wholelife was given up to the thought that she was mother, and to bea perfect mother she must be chaste. It seems Swamiji dwelton the fact that personal purity was an ideal that was held aloftfor women (as also for boys) in India, for in contrastingAmerican women with Indian women he said the following.\u201cThe girls of India would die if they, like American girls, wereobliged to expose half their bodies to the vulgar gaze of youngmen\u201d. (And yet, one may say, those were days of what wascalled Victorian prudery, the miniskirt and the topless beingfar beyond anybody\u2019s mental horizon.) We do not know howthis criticism was taken by American women, but we are sureSWAMIJI AT DETROITSWAMI VIVEKANANDA808that the following statement which is ascribed to him in TheTribune article, if it had been made in the public lecture also,should have caused a furor as the remarks he made on the rightsof Indian women to property in a lecture at the Pouch Mansionat Brooklyn on  20 January 1895 did among the ladies of theRamabai Circle. According to this report, Swamiji said, \u201cAs totheir property laws, the wife\u2019s dowry belongs to her exclusively,never becoming the property of her husband. She can sell orgive away without his consent. The gifts from any one to herself,including those of her husband, are hers alone, to do with asshe pleases\u201d. (In his Pouch Mansion lecture Swamiji went alittle further in elaborating his point and said, \u201cIn India womanhas enjoyed property rights since thousands of years. Here aman may disinherit his wife, in India the whole estate of thedeceased husband must go to the wife, personal propertyabsolutely, real property for life\u201d. In his Pasadena lectureSwamiji dwelt on one more disadvantage that the nineteenthcentury Western women suffered from as contrasted with thoseof India. Said he, \u201cIt is a strange fact that Oxford and Cambridgeare closed to women today, so are Harvard and Yale; butCalcutta University opened its doors to women more thantwenty years ago\u201d.It was while he was at Detroit, and probably during thedays when he was staying with Mr Palmer, that Swamiji brokewith the Lecture Bureau. His contract with them was for threeyears, but he wanted to get a release because, for a number ofreasons, it had become an irksome bondage for him. In thefirst place, he disliked their fixed itineraries, drawn up bymanagers, who exploited and embarrassed him by beating thebig drum as if it were a circus turn, as says M. Romain Rolland.He may have even felt that they were not quite indispensable,or had not been absolutely necessary so far as fixing up809engagements was concerned, since some of them had beenarranged independently of the Bureau, though in all cases theyhad claimed and received what they considered as their shareof the earnings. To cite some instances, he had come toMinneapolis at the invitation of the Peripatetic Club; Dr. H. O.Breeden had arranged  for his lectures at Des Moines; theNineteenth Century Club, some members of which had cometo know him during the Parliament days at Chicago, broughthim to Memphis; and the Unity Club first sponsored him inDetroit.134 He had not needed help for arranging lectures forhim at Chicago, or at Evanston, where Dr. Wright\u2019s friend, Dr.Bradley lived. The Lecture Bureau probably arranged for thelectures at such wayside places as Streator, Ada, Bay City,Saginaw, etc. At the time when he was perhaps fed up withlecturing to unappreciative audiences (\u201cstrewing pearls beforethe swine,\u201d as he wrote to the Hale Sisters on 15 March 1894)they were probably further insisting on his lecturing in a fewmore such places in Michigan, which he did not like to do. Ina letter to the Sisters on 12 March 1894, he had written, \u201cI amnot going to lecture in Michigan. Mr. Holden tried to persuademe this morning to lecture in Michigan but I am quite bentupon seeing a little of Boston and New York\u201d. (We do not knowfor certain who Holden was but it is possible he was one of themanagers of the Lecture Bureau.) In his 15 March letter to hissisters, addressed as \u201cDear Babies\u201d, he said that he had givenup Holden, and found another fellow. This perhaps means thathe had got his release from the contract with the Lecture Bureau.In any case, he had become a free man by 20 March, as weknow from what he told a reporter of the Bay City Daily Tribuneon that day: \u201cI go east next and will spend some time at Bostonand New York. . . . When I have seen America I shall go toEurope\u201d.135SWAMIJI AT DETROITSWAMI VIVEKANANDA810His earnings from his lectures had freed him fromfinancial worries to the extent at least that he had been savedfrom dependence on others for his personal requirements. Butthe story that was current in Detroit to the effect that he wasmaking money by his \u201csensational campaign in the effort topropagate... heathenism\u201d was untrue. If he had laid by any littleamount of  money with a view to using it for his \u201cproject\u201d inIndia, he had to relinquish almost every cent of it to secure hisrelease from his contract with the Lecture Bureau, and eventhat had been possible only because of the efforts of hisinfluential friends such as, perhaps, Mr. Palmer who went toChicago on his behalf and broke the contract, and others. TheLecture Bureau not only made him pay a heavy price forconsenting to cancel the contract, they had cheated him rightand left by appropriating to themselves a much greaterpercentage of his earnings than was customary. An indicationof how they mulcted him is to be found in what he wrote toAlasinga on 11 July 1894, \u201cIn the Detroit lecture I got $ 900,i.e., Rs. 2700. In other lectures, I earned in one, $ 2,500, i.e.Rs. 7,500 in one hour, but got only 200 dollars. I was cheatedby a roguish Lecture Bureau. I have given them up\u201d.136 Swamijialso heartily disliked the manner in which they had advertisedhim \u2014 in keeping with the best American ways of highsalesmanship (as an elephant or a patent medicine could beadvertised, says Romain Rolland) \u2014 and was feeling that hehad not come to America to earn money like that. And what,after all, had he earned? Mrs. Burke calculates his earnings,taking the tour as a whole, to be about $ 75 per lecture. Acontemporary, writing in the Detroit Critic of 25 March, hadthe following to say about his earnings in Detroit, \u201cThe fact isthat he is making barely anything. He has been here now somesix weeks, and during that time has given a public lecture atthe Detroit Opera House, one at the Auditorium, one in a church811and one or two in the State. At the first, the Opera House gotabout all the money in sight; at the Auditorium, unless Mrs.Bagley made him the present of the use of the building \u2014which seems possible as he has been her guest \u2014 he did wellif he cleared expenses; at the church, I don\u2019t know how hecame out, probably better than anywhere else. The afternoontalks at private houses which gave him his reputation are asfree as air\u201d. In the abovementioned letter to Alasinga, he wrote,11 July 1894, \u201cI spent a good deal here, only about $ 3,000remain\u201d.Swamiji left Detroit soon after he had delivered hislecture on the \u201cWomen of India\u201d; the exact date of his departureis not known but on 29 March he was still there, because hewrote a letter to Rev. Hume from that place on that date. Hehad been put to a lot of strain since his first arrival at the cityabout a month and a half earlier on 12 February and he wasexhausted both in mind and body. Talking on a wide variety ofsubjects incessantly it was during times like these when (as weread in The Life) he sometimes felt as if he had exhaustedhimself intellectually and had to ask himself, \u201cWhat is to bedone? What shall I say in my lecture tomorrow?\u201d At such times,however, certain strange things happened \u2014 which wereperhaps further indications of the development of yogic powersin him (discussed by us in the preceding chapter). He himselfinterpreted them as manifestations of the wider functioning offaculties, as subjective, as mere automatic workings of themind.137 At dead of night he would hear a voice shouting athim the very thought he was to speak on the morrow. Or itwould be like someone delivering a lecture alongside of him,as he lay on his bed listening. That these were not merelysubjective experiences was proved by the fact that sometimesthese voices were heard by some of the inmates of the sameSWAMIJI AT DETROITSWAMI VIVEKANANDA812residence and they would ask him in the morning, \u201cWith whomwere you talking last night, Swamiji?\u201dBe that as it may, Swamiji at this time was gettingdisgusted with the life that he was living \u2014 the monk withinhim was revolting at receptions and dinners and lectures in theglare of publicity. He was questioning also whether \u2014 havingcome to America to deliver a message \u2014 he was following theright method by which he could do so. As we shall see presentlya change was coming. He gave an indication of this in a letterto  the Hale Sisters dated 15 March 1894, in which inter alia,he said, \u201cI am wearied of lecturing and all that nonsense. Thismixing with hundreds of varieties of the human animal hasdisturbed me. I will tell you what is to my taste; I cannot writeand I cannot speak, but I can think deeply, and when I amheated can speak fire. It should be, however, to a select, a veryselect few. Let them if they will, carry and scatter my ideasbroadcast. . I am really not `cyclonic\u2019 at all. Far from it. WhatI want is not here, nor can I longer bear this `cyclonic\u2019atmosphere. This is the way to perfection, to strive to be perfectand to strive to make perfect a few men and women. My ideaof doing good is this: to evolve out a few giants, and not tostrew pearls before the swine, and so lose time, health andenergy\u201d.138As we have seen above, Swami Vivekananda left Detroittowards the end of March 1894, with the idea perhaps that hewas never again to return to it. The rest of the year and thefollowing year we find him lecturing in various cities inMassachusetts, Maine, Maryland, and a few neighbouringstates, holding classes in New York, visiting England, etc. Hecame occasionally to his \u2018home\u2019 at Chicago for rest, but thoughDetroit was near, he did not think of paying one more visit to813it. In the early part of 1896, however, when his American workwas nearly finished, he paid a brief visit to Detroit, beingperhaps earnestly requested by two of his pupils of ThousandIsland Park classes, Miss Christine Greenstidel and Mrs. MaryC. Funke, both of whom belonged to Detroit, to do so. Hereached Detroit on 3 March and stayed there for about twoweeks. At this time Mrs. Bagley, and possibly also Mr. Palmer,were away (the former making a prolonged stay at Colorado,where one of her daughters was recovering from tuberculosis).Swamiji was accompanied by his stenographer, the faithfulGoodwin, and they occupied a suite of rooms at the Richelieu,a small family hotel. By this  time Swamiji\u2019s method of workhad changed, and the days he stayed at the city were mostlyspent in holding classes (as he had been doing then at NewYork) in the drawing room of the hotel, which, unfortunately,was not large enough to accommodate the crowd that soughtadmittance. He, however, delivered two public lectures, bothon \u201cThe Ideal of Universal Religion\u201d at the temple Bath E1, ofwhich the Rabbi Louis Grossman, one of his most ardentadmirers and supporters, was the pastor. Like the classes at thehotel, the church was overcrowded, and here they almost feareda panic. Swamiji at this time seemed to be possessed of divinemadness \u2014 his heart filled with Bhakti, and almost burstingwith the desire to have the vision of the Divine Mother.Speaking about the lecture, Mrs. Funke observed, \u201cHe gave usa most brilliant and masterly discourse. Never had I seen theMaster look as he looked that night. There was something inhis Beauty not of this earth. .\u201d The subject of the lecture was\u201cThe Ideal of a Universal Religion\u201d.SWAMIJI AT DETROITSWAMI VIVEKANANDA814NOTES AND REFERENCES1 New Discoveries, cited, 566.2 C.W., cited, VIII, 301-3.3 The Life, cited II, 10.4 Reminiscences, cited, 134ff.5 Prabuddha Bharata, 1963, 162.6 In September, 1893, immediately following his appearance at theParliament of Religions, he was invited by Professor Elisha Gray, the inventorof electrical equipment, to dine at his residence at Highland Park, Prof. Grayintroduced him to other guests, who included Sir William Thompson (LaterLord Kelvin) and Professor Helmholtz who were eminent physicists. TheSwami\u2019s knowledge of electricity amazed the scientists. Incidentally the  dinnerwas a strictly vegetarian one just to show honour to the Swami (The Life, 5thedn., I, 448).7 C.W., cited, VII, 454.8 Sarat Chandra Chakravarti narrated the story (as heard by him fromSwamiji) to Swami Viswananda in a letter to him in 1939 (see New Discoveries,cited, 107-8). In his Diary, as found in C. W., V, 392, however, he gives itdifferently. There he says that Swamiji told him that \u201cby the side of a lake inAmerica\u201d he had \u201cexactly the same realization as he once had at Dakshineswar,when Sri Ramakrishna had touched him over the heart (presumably at theirsecond meeting there).\u201d9 C.W., cited, VII, 451 ff.10 C.W., cited V, 183-84.11 A.B.

In spite of this disclaimer, Swamijihad his \u201csupernatural powers\u201d always and some evidences of the fact relatingto later times are on record. Once two gentlemen came to see him at Gopal LalSil\u2019s garden house, where, after his return to Calcutta from the West in 1897 he815was staying for some time. They had come to ask him about pranayama andwere astounded when without their actually telling him about the purpose oftheir visit, he began to expound to them the very subject. On being asked howhe could do so, Swamiji told them that similar incidents had happened in theWest and people had asked him how he could know the questions that wereagitating their minds. (The Life, cited, 492-93, Vani O Rachana, cited, IX,396_97). The talk drifting to the subject of reincarnation and particularly toSwamiji\u2019s statement in the RajaYoga that it was possible for one to recollectthe events of one\u2019s past lives, one of the visitors asked him if he knew about his(Swamiji\u2019s ) past life and could tell about it, Swamiji said, \u201cI can know aboutmy past life \u2014 I do know about it \u2014 but will not tell about the details\u201d. (Ibid)Sometime after this, when Swamiji was staying at Darjeeling, two incidentshappened which indicated that Swamiji possessed these \u201cpowers\u201d. (For thetwo incidents see Chapter 12, Section X, below.) We may mention in thisconnection that Swamiji did not consider these \u201cpowers\u201d as supernatural. SisterNivedita was giving out what Swamiji thought about so-called \u201cpsychicphenomena\u201d when she referred to them in \u201cThe Master As I Saw Him\u201d (pages350_51) as follows: \u201cOccurrences falling under this head, when authentic, areobviously no more supernatural than the liquefaction of air, or the extractionof radium. Indeed the propriety of the word `supernatural\u2019 is always open todispute, inasmuch as if once a thing can be proved to occur, it is clearly withinnature, and to call it supernatural becomes, by the very fact, absurd. In India,the phenomena in question are regarded as cases of extension of faculty, andtheir explanation is sought, not in event, but in the state of mind witnessing it,since it is to be supposed that this will always, under given conditions, registera perception different from the accustomed\u201d.15New Discoveries, cited, 439.16About the Negroes, Montesquieu wrote as follows, \u201cOne cannot wellimagine that God who is so wise should have put a soul, moreover an immortalsoul, into an entirely black body. It is impossible to think that these people arehuman beings\u201d.17 Ibid., 108-9.18 Romain Rolland, Life of Vivekananda, cited.19 Letters to Mrs. Bull, 29 December 1898 and to Miss MacLeod, 2February 1899 (Vani O Rachana, cited, VIII, 52, 53).20 Vedanta Kesari, January, 1938.21 There are two versions of the story which differ a little here andthere on minor points \u2014 (1) one given by her in her autobiography, \u201cMy Life\u201d,and reproduced in the 1`, November 1922 and presumably thence in The Life,SWAMI VIVEKANANDA816350_51 and in Reminiscences, cited, 266 ff, and (2) another told by her friend,Madam Verdier, and found in New Discoveries, cited, 111-12.22 C.W., cited, VII, 507.23 Dhirendranath Basu, Sanglape Mahendranath, (Calcutta, 1970), II,67.

Without looking up much old correspondence I cannot nowremember exactly the results of that research, except that no records for 1894could be found in either Chicago or New York for any well-known lecturebureau. As I recall it, Pond\u2019s did not have a branch office in Chicago, and itsrecords in New York were destroyed by fire. All of which is most regrettable. Ayoung man in Chicago writes to me that he is trying to find Swamiji\u2019s lecturebureau \u2014 perhaps he will have better luck than I\u201d.In any case, it may be of interest for the reader to know that, when hewas on his second visit to America (1915-17), Rabindranath Tagore had engagedhimself to a Lecture Bureau, which bore the name Pond\u2019s Lycaeum, the sameas the one to which, according to Sister Christine, Swamiji had engaged himself.It is also interesting that in 1915 history repeated itself; after only a few monthsof having to move about, as on a machine, according to the programme fixedby the Bureau, the poet sought for his release, and like Swamiji again, receivedit after paying a heavy sum as compensation for breaking off his contract.According to Rabindra Jivani by Prabhat kumar Mukhopadhyaya,Vol.II., Viswabharati, 1961, 465-66, 475, Pond\u2019s Lycaeum had been foundedin New York in 1875 by James Burton Pond and named The American LectureBureau. It had arranged for the lecture tours of eminent personages, includingStanley, Emerson, Mathew Arnold, Mark Twain and Conan Doyle. After thefounder\u2019s death in 1903, the business was carried on by his son, James B.Pond, who was very helpful to the poet during his tour, who, in spite of thecompensation that he had to pay, earned sufficiently so that, on returning home,he was able to pay off some longstanding debts.817It is, however, sad to note that, if this one indeed was the Lecture Bureauto which Swamiji had engaged himself, further pursuit of the matter becomesfruitless since, as Mrs. Burke tells us, its records were completely destroyed byfire. If, however, the Bureau did have a branch in Chicago, there is still somehope.30 Reminiscences, cited, 141.31 Ibid., 126.32 Ibid., 158.33 New Discoveries, cited, 333.34 Ibid., 566.35 Ibid., 36-37.36 C.W., cited, VII, 284.37 C.W., cited, VII, 255.38 C.W., cited, V, 61; Vani O Rachana, cited, VII, 34.(The secondsentence in the quotation is unaccountably omitted in C.W.)39 C.W., cited VII, 472; Vani O Rachana, cited, VII, 43-44. It would,however, be wrong to take these words to mean that he thought that Americanswere more charitably minded than Indians. As a matter of fact he was of opinionthat the truth lay the other way. He wrote to Alasinga on 21 September 1894,\u201cThere is no hope for money for our project here. . . . The Westerners aremiserly in comparison to our race, only they (Indians) are very poor\u201d.

In the same strain, Swamiji told Priya Nath Sinha, \u201cTogive and take is the law of nature. . . . We must follow that law. That is why Iwent to America. So great is now the thirst for religion in the people there thatthere is room enough even if thousands of men like me go\u201d.

It needs, however, to be stated that in a later work. YuganayakaVivekananda, Swami Gambhirananda has gone back on this position andendorsed Mrs. Burke\u2019s view that Swami Vivekananda went to America to earnmoney for India.51 A reporter of the Appeal Avalanche of Memphis, to whose report tohis paper we shall refer more fully later, said about his project as follows. \u201cHeis not here to propagate the doctrines of any religion of India and make convertsto the same, but to raise the money wherewith to establish a polytechnicinstitution in his native land that shall be the nucleus around which he hopes tobuild an educational system that shall tend to develop the minds of his peoplealong lines of thought to which, owing chiefly to their religious beliefs, theyhave been strangers heretofore\u201d.

            "title": "CHAPTER  9SWAMI VIVEKANANDA\u2019SMISSION  IN AMERICATHE SECOND PHASEI",
            "data": "SWAMI VIVEKANANDA824When, about the first week of March, 1894, SwamiVivekananda returned to his \u201chome\u201d at Chicago, the strain ofcontinuous travelling and lecturing for about five months hadbegun to tell upon his health. He had come in splendid healthand buoyant spirits to deliver to the materialist West the spiritualmessage of the East and after performing that task in theparliament of Religions at Chicago, had stayed on to scatterthe seeds of a new philosophy of life over quite a considerableportion of the U.S.A. To thousands of Americans he hadexplained the essentials of the faith of his ancestors and theirinfluence on the life of his people as also their manners andcustoms, the ideals of their womanhood, etc., and at the sametime sought to remove the prejudices that had been created inAmerican minds about them by the Christian missionaries.Broadly, he had succeeded in his mission; the frog-in-the-wellmentality of orthodox Christians had been shaken and therewas a growing realization that the West had something to learnfrom the East \u2014 at least that there was something worthlistening to and pondering over \u2014 and the net result was thegrowth of a spirit of tolerance of other faiths and philosophiesof life. As we have seen, however, though thousands ofAmericans were spiritually benefited by Swami Vivekananda\u2019spreachings and many by living contact with him, there were825others, the spiritually blind and purblind as also those whowillfully shut their eyes to any new light; and they opposedhim tooth and nail. Their opposition did not dampen his spirits:\u201cthe more I have been opposed,\u201d he said, in a letter he wrote inthe following year, \u201cthe more my energy has always foundexpression\u201d. But at this time his once robust frame was showingsigns of exhaustion, and he was doubting whether the methodhe had been following \u2014 endlessly talking \u2014 was the rightmethod he should follow in carrying out his mission. Indicationsof these had, as we have seen, appeared in what he had writtenin a letter to the Hale Sisters on 15 March 1894, to which wehave referred above.1In the same letter there was a hint that he was thinkingof leaving America and going back home (or perhapsproceeding to Europe, an idea which was always present in hismind). \u201cI do not care for lecturing anymore,\u201d he wrote in thisletter. \u201cIt is too disgusting. . However, I will come back toChicago for a day or two at least before I go out of this country\u201d.Even after he had decided to stay on in America, he wrote on 1May 1894 to Isabelle McKindley, \u201cI am having very nice time.\u2014 only that nasty lecturing \u2014 disgusting\u201d. In his letter of 15March 1894 there was a hint that he was thinking about adifferent method of work \u2014 \u201cto evolve out a few giants\u201d \u2014and we shall see that this idea deepened in his mind and thatafter some months he did attempt to make a beginning in thisventure by opening Vedanta classes in New York. But, for thepresent, it was not to be \u2014 and, always knowing that he was inGod\u2019s hands, he allowed himself, as soon as some rest atChicago had brought about an improvement in his health, tocontinue the course that he was following up to this time.Strangely enough, even in the letter of 15 March 1894, in whichhe indicated his strong aversion for the lecturing business, heIN GOD\u2019S HANDSWAMI VIVEKANANDA826enquired of the Hale Sisters about a certain lady in Lynn, aboutwhom he said he had been advised by Mrs. Hale that he shouldwrite to her and he asked his sisters to post him up a littleabout her. On 30 March we find him informing Mary Hale thatthis lady \u2014 Mrs. Francis W. Breed \u2014 after writing to him \u201castiff burning letter\u201d had sent him a telegram asking him to cometo Lynn and be her guest for a week. At the same time, said he,he had got a letter from Mrs. Smith of New York, writing onher behalf and another lady, Miss Helen Gould, and Dr.Guernsey, asking him to come over to New York. He haddecided to go to New York first, says he, because the lecturearranged for him at Lynn was on the 17th of the followingmonth.So Swamiji had changed his mind again \u2014 the thoughtof visiting Europe, or of returning to India had receded in hismind and he was now resolved upon once more leading thelife of an itinerant lecturer. \u201cWhen my feet will get fettered,\u201dhe wrote to Swami Ramakrishnananda, \u201cHe knows.\u201d2 (1894)Thus began what one may call the second phase of his activitiesin America, during which he gave himself up apparently tolecturing as he had done in the past few months, but was reallyevolving a new plan, which he devoted himself almost entirelyto during the rest of his stay in America. It was specially duringthe summer of 1894 \u2014 some months on the one hand of respitefrom the lecturing business and on the other hand of uneasinessat growing knowledge of the hostile propaganda that was beingcarried on against him in India and America \u2014 that the newidea was developing in his mind.The scene of Swamiji\u2019s activities was now to shift furtherto the northeast in a number of States lying on the Atlanticcoast and, in particular, Massachusetts, at the capital city of827which, viz., Boston, he had turned for a shelter during his daysof acute financial stringency before the Parliament met atChicago. Close to Boston is Cambridge, the seat of the famousHarvard University \u2014 founded in 1636, and educational leaderof America ever since \u2014 where his friend, John Henry Wright,was a professor. At Cambridge, too, lived Mrs. Ole Bull, widowof the famous violinist, Ole Bull, at a splendid mansion where,in a large living room panelled in Indian teakwood, she heldfor two successive years the so-called \u201cCambridgeConferences\u201d, in which social problems were discussed by theleaders of the city\u2019s intellectual society. Among them were tobe found Prof. William James and leaders of causes, like thestill active seventy-five year old Mrs. Julia Ward Howe, theseventy-one year old Col. Thomas Wentworth Higgins andothers, about some of whom we shall say more below. SwamiVivekananda\u2019s acquaintance with Mrs. Ole Bull was aprovidential happening, turning, into a lifelong friendship. Hecalled her \u201cmother\u201d, not by any means \u201ca matter of Hindurhetoric\u201d, and she, with her deep spiritual nature, looked uponhim as son and guru and gave him and his cause, even after hehad passed away, her wholehearted support, not the least partof which was lavish financial help.While a considerable part of Swami Vivekananda\u2019sactivities during this period was carried on in some places inMassachusetts, it extended also to some of the contiguous States\u2014 Maine, which is situated to the north of this State,Connecticut which is to its south, New York which is to itswest, Pennsylvania, which is to the south of New York,Maryland, which is to the latter\u2019s south, and to Washington,which is in the District of Columbia and is the capital of the U.S. A. He did not go deep into the territories of these States, hisactivities being confined mostly to some villages and citiesIN GOD\u2019S HANDSWAMI VIVEKANANDA828situated along or near the coasts of these States, but everywherehis visits had significant results. In Massachusetts, SwamiVivekananda visited, besides Boston and Cambridge, whichwere the major centres of his activities, Northampton, acharming old town lying halfway between Boston and NewYork and later to be better known as then home of CalvinCoolidge, the thirtieth American President; Lynn, an industrialcity ten miles from Boston; Swampscott, a beautiful residentialtown and summer resort on Massachusetts Bay, 13 milesnortheast of Boston, adjoining Lynn; Annisquam, a seasidehamlet further to the north, where he had first met Prof. Wright;Plymouth, a town and port on Plymouth Bay, 37 miles S. E. ofBoston, famous as the landing place of the Pilgrims and thefirst permanent settlement by Europeans in New England; andMelrose, a small town on the Boston and Maine railroad, 7miles N. of Boston. In Maine State, Swami Vivekananda cameonly once with a view to attending, as we shall see later, areligious conference at Greenacre, a summer colony or retreaton a river, near Eliot which was approached by steamer fromPortsmouth (New Hampshire), just across the Massachusettsborder. In New Hampshire, he visited Percy, and lived therefor a few days as the guest of Mr. Leggett but he does not seemto have delivered any lecture there. In New York State, whichis to the west of Massachusetts, he visited New York City wherein Manhattan he settled down for a time holding his lectureclasses and delivered lectures on various occasions. Also there,at Brooklyn in Long Island, he delivered lectures at theinvitation of the Brooklyn Ethical Association and its president,Dr. Lewis G. Janes, who became one of his devoted friends. Atthe invitation of Dr. and Mrs. Egbert Guernsey of New York,who had evidently taken him into their family, as Mr. and Mrs.G. W. Hale had done at Chicago, and Mrs. Bagley had done atDetroit, he stayed for a few days at Fishkill Landing, which829was a small place on the Hudson River in New York State. InPennsylvania, Swami Vivekananda visited Philadelphia, where,in 1776, the American colonists in revolt against England hadadopted their momentous Declaration of Independence. Hecame there to see Prof. Wright and stayed for a few days only.To the south of Pennsylvania lies the State of Maryland, whichis bisected by Chesapeake Bay, at the head of an estuary ofwhich is situated the chief town of the State, Baltimore, namedafter the Lord Baltimore who had founded a colony there. (TheLife, cited, 416, says that Swamiji visited all the larger citiesof the Eastern and Midwestern States and includes, in the listof the cities he lectured at, St. Louis in Missouri, Hartford inConnecticut, and Buffalo in New York. It, however, does notgive any further information regarding either the visits or thelectures. In her work, New Discoveries, cited, 134, Mrs. Burkeobserves that most probably St. Louis was not included inSwamiji\u2019s itinerary. On the rest of The Life\u2019s statement shemakes no comments, the implication being that it can neitherbe confirmed nor contradicted.)After he had freed himself from the tutelage of theLecture Bureau, Swamiji expected that he would be able tocarry on his work as he liked, but for some time this hope wasnot realized. Mrs. Hale had given him a number of introductoryletters before he left Chicago \u2014 these being mostly addressedto society women of various places in Massachusetts andelsewhere, like Mrs. Breed of Lynn, Mrs. Totten of Washington,among others, who had connections at Chicago. The latterarranged for engagements for him at their own places and,through their friends, at other places. For a time thus, Swamijiwas, as Romain Rolland says, \u201cmonopolized by a group ofrich friends\u201d \u2014 mostly women. Without comprehending histeachings, or grasping the significance of his mission, they wereIN GOD\u2019S HANDSWAMI VIVEKANANDA830ready, or even anxious, to help him. They were attracted tohim by his personality, or because, as they vaguely understood,he had a cause, and in those days in America, women, whowere getting conscious that they had a distinctive role to playin the life of the nation, were the friends of all \u201ccauses\u201d. Inmany cases, however, they, with their offers to \u201cfinance\u201d him,imposed conditions upon him, which he found to be no lessgalling than those under which he had worked in accordancewith his contract with the Lecture Bureau. He was to say\u201csweet\u201d things, behave \u201csweetly\u201d to all and sundry and underall circumstances and, above all, to move about only in theexclusive society to which they themselves belonged. Swamijidid comply with these conditions as far as he could do sowithout compromising with truth but he chafed under them,because he belonged to the people and asserted that none hadexclusive claims on him. The opening of lecture classes in poorquarters in New York in January, 1895 marked his final releasefrom all such influences.We have said above that Swami Vivekananda hadreceived an invitation from Mrs. Breed of Lynn to deliver alecture there on 17 April 1894 and stay there as her guest for aweek but that, as he had received some invitations from NewYork to come over there, he had decided to go to the latterplace first. Actually, however, before proceeding to any of thesetwo places, he paid a visit to a third place, viz., Northampton,which was about halfway between New York and Boston, andthus perhaps lay on his way from Chicago to Lynn and where aprogramme of two lectures had been arranged for him, we donot know how. We have an elaborate account of Swamiji\u2019s visitto this city from Martha Brown Fincke, who at the time was afreshman at a local women\u2019s college (Smith College) andresiding at a house near the campus, kept by a lady, who was831bold enough to admit a dark-skinned man (Swamiji) to it, afterhe had been refused admission by the hotel. Mrs. Fincke\u2019sreminiscences, which were contributed to the PrabuddhaBharata in 1936, forty-two years after Swamiji\u2019s visit toNorthampton and when she was aged 60, are inaccurate aboutsome details (for example, she says that Swamiji visited theplace in November, 1893.) But they give us a vivid picture ofSwamiji\u2019s appearance and bearing (to her, aged nineteen, heseemed to personify Power, says she.) She is not fair to herselfwhen, speaking about the influence that Swamiji had on hermind; she says that she did not follow his teachings, so that \u201casfar as outward result goes, I am a case of the good seed chokedby thorns\u201d. When she wrote the reminiscences, she could recallnothing of the lecture Swamiji had delivered in the City Hallon 14 April 1894. She also had nothing but a little vague ideaabout the subjects discussed between Swamiji and someChristian stalwarts at a symposium held at their boardinghousethe same evening. Yet we have it from herself that when thediscussions went on she found that all her sympathies werewith the stranger in their midst, and not with her own people,since it was he who was rising above creeds and sects andthereby broadening the scope of religion till it embraced allmankind. Her freethinking, says she, certainly dated \u201cfrom theawakening given me by that freedom loving soul\u201d.Soon after Swamiji had arrived at Northampton, ameeting was arranged between him and a group of gentlemenat an Elm Street residence. The latter were captivated by theSwami\u2019s many-sided intellect, subtle wisdom and broadvisioned culture, which were supplemented by a singularlymagnetic attractiveness of personality \u2014 as the NorthamptonDaily Herald of 14 April 1894 put it. The lecture that hedelivered at the City Hall on the following evening (14 April)IN GOD\u2019S HANDSWAMI VIVEKANANDA832was on The Manners and Customs of the Hindus, and wassummarized and editorialized by the same paper in its issue of16 April 1894. It appears that Swamiji began his lecture withstating that Americans and Indians were racially similar \u2014cousins who differed only a trifle in colour, language, customsand religion. He described the life of a Hindu from his boyhood,diverging off and on to make comparative comments on thecustoms and manners of the Indians and the English-speakingraces, socially, morally and religiously. As usual, he spoke inhighly eulogistic terms about the ideal of Indian womanhood,which he portrayed as that of the divine motherhood, and ofthe reverence \u2014 even worship \u2014 that women received in Indianhomes. He criticized sharply \u201cthe greed for gain, the nationalvice of luxury seeking, the `dollar caste\u2019 sentiment that taintedthe dominant white European and American races to theirmortal danger\u201d in superb style and in his \u201csoft, quiet,unimpassioned musical voice\u201d, which reached straight to thehearts of his listeners. While admitting these criticisms as just,the editor remarked, however, that when the speaker went onto show that his own religion had proved itself superior in itsusefulness to Western culture and religion, he was attempting\u201ca large contract\u201d. The editor ended his observations withstating that to see and hear Swami Vivekananda was anopportunity which none should miss.There were others, like the editor, who questioned theaccuracy of Swamiji\u2019s comparative estimate of eastern andwestern cultures and among them not quite a few who, unlikehim, were of the view that everything that was Western wasgood and everything that was Eastern was bad. In a Presbyterianstronghold like Northampton, there was also a good numberof orthodox Christians who held that Christianity was the onlytrue religion, etc. This became quite evident when, soon after833Swamiji had returned to the boardinghouse from the lecturehall, a number of black coated and somewhat austere gentlemen(as Martha Browne Fincke describes them) called on theSwami. They engaged themselves in a discussion with himand attempted to prove that all truth was with them alone.Among them were the College President and some professors,including the Head of the Philosophy Department, and theministers of the local churches. The girls sat in a corner, eagerlylistening to the discussions. Surely, thought they, Swamiji wasat a disadvantage: how far could he go in argumentation withhis challengers, who knew their Bibles thoroughly and werewell versed in European systems of philosophy as well as thepoets and commentators? But, no! \u201cTo texts from the Bible,the Swami replied by other and more apposite ones from thesame book. In upholding his side of the argument he quotedEnglish philosophers and writers on religious subjects. Eventhe poets he seemed to know thoroughly, quoting Wordsworthand Thomas Grey (not from the well-known Elegy). . . Thediscussion beginning with the utmost courtesy, became lesscordial, then bitterness crept in, a resentment on the part of thechampions of Christianity as they felt that it was `hands down\u2019for them. And truly it was\u201d.Swami Vivekananda delivered one more lecture atNorthampton, the subject being the brotherhood of man andthe fatherhood of God, and the place Smith College, before hestarted for Lynn to keep his engagement there with Mrs. Breed.This lady, who originally belonged to Chicago and was no doubtknown to the Hales, had married a very wealthy boots andshoes manufacturer of Lynn, was something of a Grande dame,and was just the sort of a society woman, described above byus, who was happy to espouse \u201ccauses\u201d. Lynn, which from itsearliest days was a manufacturing centre \u2014 the distinctiveSWAMIJI  AT NORTHAMPTONSWAMI VIVEKANANDA834industry being boots and shoes, its women\u2019s shoes beingespecially famous \u2014was a cosmopolitan town, 25% of thepopulation being foreign-born. At its foundation a Puritan town,it subsequently had a heavy infiltration of Irish, Italians, Poles,Czechs and others who were Catholics. Swami Vivekanandadelivered two lectures at this city, the first at the North ShoreClub, of which Mrs. Breed was a charter member, on 17 April,and the second before the general public at Oxford Hall on 18April. The lectures were not reported in the local papers, andwe know nothing about them beyond the fact that the subjectof the first lecture was \u201cThe Manners and Customs of India\u201d.While at Lynn, Swamiji had the pleasure of paying one or moreflying visits to Boston, only 10 miles away, where he met hisfriend, Prof. Wright, and made many new acquaintances.From Lynn Swami Vivekananda proceeded to New Yorkwhere he stayed for two weeks (24 April to 6 May). (It will behelpful to note that New York is the post office designation ofthe largest metropolis in the United States. Officially, it is Cityof New York, and popularly it is called New York City.Originally situated in Manhattan Island, it expanded first intoWestchester County. In 1898 it was organized into boroughs,which included Brooklyn and other localities in Long Islandand Staten Island. Thus was formed Greater New York, but theterm never proved popular. What needs remembering is that atthe time of Swami Vivekananda\u2019s visits to the city during hisfirst visit to the West, New York and Brooklyn were citiesgrowing up in friendly rivalry with each other in ManhattanIsland and Long Island respectively, so that when we refer toNew York the city in Manhattan Island is meant, as distinctfrom Brooklyn on Long Island.) In an earlier Chapter we havealready spoken of the importance of New York, the hub of thepredominantly industrial region of the Northeast, and \u201cthe835humming centre of New World Civilization\u201d. The Northeast,as the part of the American continent nearest to Europe, had,as we have seen, the heaviest infiltration of settlers from allparts of Europe and served as \u201cthe melting pot\u201d of diversepeoples and cultures into what are known as Americans andAmerican \u201cway of life\u201d. Swamiji, in whose character the heroicwas a predominating element, felt quite at ease in the hurryand bustle of life in the crowded streets and skyscrapers ofNew York, which he recognized as manifestations of Power(Sakti) and as but so many pointers to human progress. Thewooded hills and other beautiful natural phenomena thatadjoined the cities refreshed his mind and spirit, and he wassometimes taken by his friends to seaside places, where heenjoyed yachting, once overturning his boat and spoiling hishandsome ochre coloured suit.For many reasons such as the abovementioned ones,Swami Vivekananda came to consider New York as speciallysuited for his work, and it gradually became the \u201cfocal point\u201dof his activities, till he settled down there for a time early in1895 to conduct the Vedanta classes. (New York still remainsa prominent centre of the activities of the Ramakrishna Missionin America.) However, during his two weeks\u2019 stay at New York,24 April to 6 May, he delivered two lectures and held talks,which were attended by some of those who were to be hisprincipal coadjutors in his American work, and attracted themto his personality and mission. He thereby laid down, thoughperhaps still largely unconsciously, the line on which work wasto be carried on in the near future by himself and his disciples.His first lecture was on 24 April at the Waldorf Hotel beforethe \u201cConversation Circle\u201d of Mrs. Arthur Smith (who, as wehave seen above, had invited him to come to New York), thesubject being \u201cIndia and Hinduism\u201d. The other lecture was atSWAMIJI  AT NORTHAMPTONSWAMI VIVEKANANDA836the home of Miss Mary Phillips on the evening of 2 May on\u201cIndia and Reincarnation\u201d. From Swamiji\u2019s letters to IsabelleMcKindley dated 26 April and 2 May,3 we know that the firstlecture was delivered before a full house, the hall, however,being a small one, and that Mrs. Smith sold tickets at $ 2 each,Swamiji getting $ 70. The lecture was very briefly reportedwithout any comments in the New York Daily Tribune of 25April, and among those whose names were mentioned as havingattended it were Dr. and Mrs. Guernsey, Miss Mary Phillips,and Mrs. Arthur Smith. We find from the report that in thecourse of his lecture Swamiji touched on the subject ofreincarnation. He answered the question that is usually raisedwith regard to it, viz., why, if we had a former life, we areunconscious about it, by the argument that we are unconsciousof our birth in this life as we are also of much that has transpired.Swamiji touched more controversial ground when hechallenged the Christian belief in \u201ca Judgment Day\u201d and saidthat \u201cno such thing\u201d existed in his religion and that his godneither punished nor rewarded.Swami Vivekananda\u2019s second lecture at New York wasalso reported in the abovementioned paper, again without anycomments, though the lecture contained some statementswhich, expressed elsewhere, had raised fierce controversies. Itmay be mentioned in passing that Swamiji had a good opinionof the New Yorkers. On 1 May 1894 he wrote to IsabelleMcKindley, \u201cBy the by, your New York people are very good\u2014 only more money than brains\u201d.4 On 20 August 1894, heagain wrote to her, contrasting them with Bostoners, \u201cTheBoston people as quickly take hold of anything as give it up;while the New Yorkers are slow, but when they got hold ofanything they do it with a mortal grip\u201d.5 On 21 September 1894he wrote to Alasinga, \u201cNew York is the head, hand, and purse837of the country. The New York people are very open.\u201d6 On 28December 1894, he wrote to Mrs. Bull, \u201cHere alone in NewYork I find more men interested in religion than in any othercity, and do not know why here the interest is more amongstmen than women\u201d.7 Swamiji drew a distinction betweenreligion and sect, the former, according to him, consisting in abelief of the truth of all creeds, and the latter in the belief thatone certain dogma was the real and only religion. It may beremembered that Swamiji had expressed this view in a lectureat Des Moines and that, in the course of his talk with a reporterof the Detroit Free Press, had followed up the argument withthe statement that, accordingly, he did not consider Christianityas a religion. The second lecture was attended by a number ofmembers of the Emerson Club. (Transcendentalism, which hadsome roots in Hindu thought, was evidently not quite dead yet,and we shall have something more to say about it later.) Alsopresent at the lecture was the famous singer, Miss EmmaThursby, who was a friend of Mrs. Ole Bull and who, alongwith Mrs. Arthur Smith and Miss Mary Phillips, was later tohelp Swamiji in organizing the Vedanta classes in the city. Itwas also here that we first find Mr. Leon Landsberg, a Russianborn Jew who had become a naturalized American citizen andwho soon became one of the most active and ardent followersof Swamiji, lived with him for some months in a house in NewYork, and later betrayed him. About Dr. and Mrs. Guernsey,who attended this meeting also, we have already spoken: theybefriended him in more ways than one. Miss Mary Phillips, atwhose home at 19 West 38th Street the second lecture wasdelivered, later became one of Swamiji\u2019s best friends, offeringhim her hospitality and help in various ways, especially inorganizing the New York lecture classes. Swamiji regarded herhome as his headquarters and used its address as his returnaddress in many of his letters to India. (In 1895, he wrote toSWAMIJI  AT NEW YORKSWAMI VIVEKANANDA838Swami Saradananda from London. \u201cSend the books to America,c/o Miss Mary Phillips, 19 W. 38th Street, New York, U. S. A.That is my American address\u201d.)8 Thus, during this visit to NewYork, there were gathering round him the persons, who wereto be the nucleus of the Vedanta movement that extended tomany parts of America in the near future.While at New York, Swami Vivekananda was invited tospeak in many private homes and before clubs, though we haveinformation about only a very few of them. We know somethingof \u201ca dinner party of creeds\u201d given at his house by Dr. Guernsey,perhaps to introduce Swamiji before the leaders of churches inNew York, from an account of it by Mrs. Constance Towne.9Mrs. Towne (then Miss Gibbons) had been asked by Dr.Guernsey, who was her physician, to represent Catholicism.From time to time Swamiji made a little speech in explanationof the manners and customs of India, but it was not becausethere was a tacit understanding among the guests that everyoneshould be polite about his or her religious differences with him,that there was no heated debate with him. Mrs. Towne says,\u201cAlas! as the dinner progressed, the most heated dispute wasnot with the Swami at all. All of the differences were confinedto the Evangelical brethren!\u201d Among those who attended thedinner was Dr. Charles H. Park Hurst, who was one of thebest-known clergymen of the day, and had recently come intoprominence as a critic of corruption in the municipal life ofNew York. We do not know how Swamiji and he got alongtogether at the dinner, but it is possible that he found corruptionat home a more delectable subject to talk about than Gangacrocodiles. Nor do we know what impression Swamiji producedon the mind of another noted clergyman who was present there,Lyman Abbott, who invited him to a lunch at his house on 3May. Lyman Abbott had probably made Swamiji\u2019s acquaintance839at the Parliament of Religions where, however, it is not likelythat either of them had felt that he had a kinship in spirit withthe other. Dr. Barrows quotes with approval the following thatMr. Abbott had said in one of his speeches in the Parliament,\u201cThe difference between Christianity and other religions is thatwe have something that they have not, we have the Christ, therevelation of God, the ideal Man, the loving and sufferingSaviour\u201d.10 Though he later became, with reservation, one ofSwamiji\u2019s friends, it is not likely that the latter\u2019s belief inuniversal tolerance ever affected his thoughts. At any rate wehave the fact that when the Christian missionaries in India,alarmed at reports about Swamiji\u2019s success  in America,enquired from him about their truth, he replied making light ofSwamiji\u2019s work and asserting that \u201cthe Church of Christ goeson its way increasing\u201d.From New York, Swami Vivekananda proceeded toBoston, \u201cthe Athens of America\u201d, at one time the home of theTranscendentalist movement, and now rapidly changing onaccount of growing commercialism and utilitarianism.Although he received an invitation from Prof. Wright to be hisguest at Annisquam and he accepted it, for some reason orother, he remained during the whole of this visit, lasting abouta fortnight, at Boston. That was much to the relief of Mrs.Wright, who was worrying about the packing that \u201cwas morethan she could manage with a Heathen God always at hand,\u201das she recorded in her diary. However, we owe to her diarysome information about some of Swamiji\u2019s lectures at Boston.His first lecture was delivered on 7 May before Mrs. Howe\u2019sWomen\u2019s Club, and though we do not know anything aboutwhat he said there we may feel sure that it delighted OldEnglanders like Mrs. Howe who still had Transcendentalismin their hearts and were desperately striving to keep the oldSWAMIJI  AT NEW YORKSWAMI VIVEKANANDA840members alive. Swamiji\u2019s next lecture was delivered on thefollowing day at Radcliffe, a recently founded women\u2019s college,associated with Harvard University and popularly known asthe \u201cAnnex\u201d. The third lecture was delivered on 10 May at\u201cMr. Coolidge\u2019s Round Table,\u201d the fourth and fifth, deliveredin aid of local charities, in Association Hall, on 14 and 16 Mayrespectively, and the sixth and last lecture at Harvard Universityon 16 May. (It may be thus seen that on 16 May Swamijidelivered two lectures, one at 3.30 in the afternoon at Boston,and the other at 8 in the evening at Cambridge.)The first three lectures were not reported in the papers,so that, as we have said above, we know nothing about the firstlecture, and about the second and third ones we know just alittle that Mrs. Wright recorded in her diary. The second lecture,delivered at a Women\u2019s college, was possibly about Indianwomen, and we gather from Mrs. Wright\u2019s account that muchof it went above the heads of his fair listeners, who, however,\u201claughed with the vexed laugh born of a sting\u201d when Swamijisaid that while the high caste Indian widows do not marry, lowcaste widows do so, and that they may eat, drink, dance, haveas many husbands as they choose, divorce them all, in shortenjoy all the benefits of the highest society in America. FromMrs. Wright\u2019s diary also we know that at his third lecture, too,Swamiji had his flings at Americans, and one feels thankful toher for recording the following. \u201cWhen we are fanatical,\u201dSwamiji said, \u201cwe torture ourselves, we throw ourselves underhuge cars, we cut our throats, we lie on spiked beds; but whenyou are fanatical you cut other peoples\u2019 throats, you torturethem by fire and put them on spiked beds. You take very goodcare of your own skins\u201d. The two lectures delivered inAssociation Hall as their subjects \u201cThe Manners and Customsof India\u201d and \u201cThe Religions of India\u201d and were favourably841commented on in the press. We do not know what exactly wasthe subject of his address at Harvard University, but from ameagre report in a paper it would appear that it was \u201cTheManners and Customs of India\u201d. It is possible that it was onthe occasion of this visit to Boston or his visit to the city earlier,in April, that he first met Mrs. Ole Bull, about whom we havealready spoken above, and who played such an important rolein his affairs.IIFrom Boston Swamiji may have gone to New York anddelivered some lectures there, as in a letter to IsabelleMcKindley dated 1 May 189411 he had said that he intended todo. We have, however, no record of this visit of his to NewYork (if he really did go there). He may have spent the wholeof June, 1894, at Chicago at the Hales\u2019 home, but we havelittle information about what he did during this month. All thatwe know about his stay in Chicago is that, while his body hada good rest, his mind was uneasy about something thatconcerned not only himself personally but his cause. We havereferred from time to time to attacks on him by the Christianmissionaries, who were afraid that his activities wouldadversely affect the prospects of missionary work in India. Thevirulence of these attacks is evidenced by the accounts we havegiven in the preceding pages of the Christian campaign againstSwamiji, notably at Detroit, where, as we have seen, an attemptwas also made to murder him by mixing poison in his coffee.Presently, a new phase in the campaign began when \u201ccertainzealots of low caste missionaries\u201d began to circulate storiesinvented by unidentified sources (according to Swamiji, \u201ctheRcircle\u201d, i.e., the Ramabai Circle) charging him withSWAMIJI  AT BOSTONSWAMI VIVEKANANDA842immorality. Unfortunately, in this campaign of vilification,some of his fellow countrymen, and specially Pratap ChandraMajumdar, joined.One could not blame Swamiji\u2019s detractors if they hadconducted their propaganda by pitting against his criticisms ofChristianity and Christian missionary activities their ownarguments in support of the doctrines Swamiji found fault withand activities which he denounced. They were even free to saythat Christianity was the only true religion and all others false,if they believed that these were so and also to assert the needof carrying on missionary activities in heathen lands. A certainamount of passion is always associated with the carrying on ofreligious controversies, and one can well understand ifintemperate statements are made in their speeches and writingsby religious bigots. That the Christian critics of Swamiji inAmerica were behind none in the world in defending theirreligion as they understood it and condemning Hinduism, ouraccounts  of their onslaught amply testify. Their propaganda,even when it was carried to indecent lengths, failed to do muchharm to Swamiji and his work in America, largely becausethere was always to be found fair-minded and better-informedAmericans who answered their charges, and because ofSwamiji\u2019s own preachings. In their desperation, thereupon, hisenemies began to have resort to mean tactics, which gave themgreater success because some Indians acted as their aiders andabettors. More unfortunate, as Swamiji thought, was the factthat, in spite of his many appeals to his Indian disciples andsupporters urging them to take the necessary steps to counteractthe false propaganda, no response came from them for a longtime. Worst of all, it was not till many months had passed thathe himself came to know that all was well with his supportersin India, with the result that he was in excruciating mental843agony and a state of suspense all the while. June, 1894 whichhe spent in Chicago was especially a black month for him inthis regard, and he had to bear his grief alone, since his \u201csisters\u201d,the Hale and McKindley girls, were vacationing elsewhere.We shall first deal with the lies that were sedulouslyspread against his moral character by some people in America,especially about a canard that was circulated in Detroit. Onedoes not like to talk about these things, since they and speciallythe scandal that somebody invented in Detroit were effectivelydisproved, and at the present day they have little but academicinterest. But as the authors of The Life12 have rightly observed,\u201cthe conventional form of `hushing things up\u2019 may be excellentin its own place but in the case of a great Teacher, allmisconceptions and unjust estimates of his character shouldbe removed\u201d. The stories that were circulated were that Mrs.Bagley, Swamiji\u2019s hostess in Detroit, had to dismiss a servantgirl on account of Swamiji\u2019s bad character, and that he was\u201cdreadfully intemperate\u201d. It seems that the charge ofintemperance was brought in first (sometime in June, 1894)and the servant girl story was invented later (sometime inMarch, 1895). Mrs. Bagley was at her summer house atAnnisquam when the accusation of intemperance was broughtto her notice by a friend of hers sometime in June, 1894. Sheimmediately wrote back to her friend strongly repudiating theallegation and expressing her high opinion of Swamiji. Theletter is a long one, and it will suffice to quote a few lines only.She wrote, \u201cYou write of my dear friend, Vivekananda. I amglad of an opportunity to express my admiration of his character,and it almost makes me indignant that any one should call himin question. He has given us in America higher ideas of lifethan we have ever had before. . . He has been a revelation toChristians. . . . It is so wrong and so untrue to say that he isAMERICAN  AND INDIAN SLANDERERSSWAMI VIVEKANANDA844intemperate. All who have been brought into contact with him,day by day, speak enthusiastically of his sterling qualities ofcharacter. . . . He has been a guest in my house more than threeweeks, and my . . . entire family found Swami Vivekananda agentleman always. I have invited him to visit us at mysummerhouse here at Annisquam, and in my family he willalways be honoured and welcomed. . He is a strong, noblehuman being, one who walks with God. He is as simple andtrustful as a child. . Every human being would be made betterby knowing him and living in the same house with him\u201d.The story of the servant girl whom Mrs. Bagley allegedlyhad to dismiss because of Swamiji\u2019s bad character was possiblyinvented a little later, may be in the following year. The personwho actually gave birth to it could not be traced \u2014 it was awhispering campaign that was carried on for some time \u2014 butit seems certain that the Ramabai Circle had much to do withits circulation, even if it was probably not they who had inventedit. Helen Bagley (Mrs. Bagley\u2019s daughter) seems to have firstheard it from a certain \u201cMrs. S.\u201d and in a letter to her motherdated 21 March 1895 expressed her resolve \u201cto find out foronce if possible who starts these lies about Vivekananda\u201d.\u201cThese things,\u201d she added, \u201ctravel fast, and if one is uprooted,perhaps these women will stop to think before they circulate astory so readily. If only they would investigate them they wouldfind how false they all are. .\u201d We do not know how far orwhether she succeeded in finding out the source of thatparticular lie, but we know that the monster that produces suchlies is hydra tongued, and we have it from Swamiji that atChicago he had found such things spread against him everyday. As we read in The Life, \u201cSometimes notes and letters weresent to persons who had invited him to their homes, whichdeclared that the Swami was not what he represented himself845to be, and contained all kinds of calumnies against him.Occasionally these notices had the desired effect, and the Swamiwould find that the doors of his intended hosts were closed tohim. But in most instances, the error would be discovered aftera time, and they would call and apologize, and become greaterfriends than ever\u201d.13 We have already told the story how Mr.George W. Hale, on receiving a letter from a \u201cwell-wisher\u201dadvising him not to allow his girls to mix with the Swami,promptly threw it into the fire. We are not sure that in everycase it happened like this \u2014 some mud sticks, as the proverbgoes, \u2014 and the Swami had to suffer sometimes.However, it was fortunate that the story that was beingcirculated about the servant girl reached Mrs. Bagley\u2019s ears,presumably from a letter from the same lady friend of herswho had given her the information a year earlier about theallegation that Swamiji was \u201cdreadfully intemperate\u201d. We donot know whether, when she came to know about it (March,1895), the canard was already at least a year old and it wasbrought to her knowledge because at the time it was given awide publicity by the ladies of the Ramabai Circle, or it was ofrecent origin. But no sooner did she hear about it than she hitthe lie squarely on the head by writing a spirited letter to herfriend, in which she not only reiterated her faith in Swamijibut stated concrete facts which effectively disproved the lie.With regard to the specific allegation, she said, \u201cMy servants,I have had many years and they are all still with me. You cansee how wholly without foundation are all these stories. Whothis woman in Detroit is, of whom you speak, I do not know. Iknow only this that every word of her story is as untrue andfalse as possible... We all know Vivekananda. Who are theythat speak so falsely?\u201d Obviously this time too her friend\u2019sletter contained other allegations against Swamiji which,AMERICAN  AND INDIAN SLANDERERSSWAMI VIVEKANANDA846without knowing what they actually were, we vaguelyunderstand, related once again to his alleged \u201cintemperance\u201din the matter of food and drink in dinners given to him in clubsand her own and other homes. In any case, she was equallyemphatic and effective in disposing of all the accusations. Shewrote, \u201cLet my first word be that all this about SwamiVivekananda is absolute falsehood from beginning to end.Nothing could be more false. We all enjoyed every day of thesix weeks he spent with us... He was invited by the differentclubs of gentlemen in Detroit, and everywhere and at all timeshe was, as he deserved to be, honored and respected... AtAnnisquam last summer I had a cottage and we wrote toVivekananda, who was at Boston, inviting him again to visitus there, which he did, remaining three weeks, not onlyconferring a favour upon us, but a great pleasure, I am sure, tofriends who had cottages near us\u201d.It seems that it was not till March, 1895 when the ladiesof the Ramabai Circle, whose corns he had unwittingly troddenon in a lecture at the Pouch Mansion, Brooklyn, on 20 January1895 (see Sections IX and X below), began to circulate thecanard about Mrs. Bagley\u2019s servant girl that Swamiji came toknow that lies were being directed against his moral character.He was not unaccustomed to falsehoods being told against him;his (Naren\u2019s) neighbours, as we have seen, talked ill about himand there was a time when some of his best friends carriedtales against his moral character to Sri Ramakrishna. But thosewere misunderstandings, not deliberate concoctions for thepurpose of harming him and his cause, as the tales circulatedabout him in America at this time were. It is shocking thatmalicious tongues would not spare even a Vivekananda, but itis a fact that there are human natures so base that to themnothing in the world is sacred and that none is too pure or847innocent to be beyond the reach of the fangs of scandal, evenblasphemy. We may be sure that these misrepresentations ofhis character hurt Swamiji, but at least outwardly he took littlenotice of them beyond writing a letter to Mrs. Bull, 21 March1895, in which he simply said that he was \u201castonished\u201d to hearthe scandals. \u201cDon\u2019t you see, Mrs. Bull,\u201d Swamiji remarked,\u201cthat however a man may conduct himself, there will alwaysbe persons who will invent the blackest lies about him\u201d. When,however, these people would not even spare his Master (aleading paper printed a picture of Sri Ramakrishna, with slurringcomments on his appearance and upon Hinduism and HinduYogis in general), Swamiji was much upset and exclaimed,\u201cOh, This is BLASPHEMY\u201d.Meanwhile, Bhai Pratap Chandra Majumdar had returnedto Calcutta and not only joined hands with the Christianmissionaries in carrying on propaganda designed to discreditSwamiji but personally vilified him. We have seen that thisBrahmo leader, who had impressed many Americans with hispiety and eloquence when he had come to America ten yearsago on a lecture tour, had risen still higher in the estimation ofa class of devout Christians in America by his performance atthe Parliament of Religions. Majumdar had known SriRamakrishna whom, along with his master, Keshub ChandraSen, and also alone, he had often visited and at whose feet hehad sat, as we read in the Kathamrita, enraptured, as he listenedto his \u2018nectarine\u2019 talks. He had, as we have seen, contributedto a journal in Calcutta an article on the saint which isremembered to this day as one of the earliest and bestappreciations of Sri Ramakrishna. Naren knew him even inthose (Dakshineswar) days, and when he (Swami Vivekananda)met him at Chicago (it seems that was before the Parliamentmet) he was very glad, since particularly he met a fellowAMERICAN  AND INDIAN SLANDERERSSWAMI VIVEKANANDA848countryman after a long time and a rare one to be met with at afar corner of the earth. The old man also must have greetedhim with a few words of courtesy, though, we may be sure, andwithout Swamiji suspecting it, he had been rather surprised tomeet a youngster about whom he did not know much beyondthat he was a frequenter at Dakshineswar, now donning amonk\u2019s garb and talking with him as an equal, being a fellowdelegate at the World\u2019s Parliament of Religions. He certainlydid not expect that the young fellow would make such animpression on the thousands of Americans who were assembledin the Hall of Columbus by just a few words, which he himselfperhaps did not think much of. Jealousy smote him. He starteddefaming Swamiji.As one among the senior most of Asian delegates and assuch having wide contacts in the circle of the Parliament\u2019sleaders and sponsors, he had a good opportunity of carrying onhis campaign against Swamiji. He found not a few among them,being orthodox Christians with a certain bent of mind, and notfeeling too happy at the phenomenal success of the young Indianmonk, or without sympathy for his views of universal tolerance,who were only too ready to listen to him. Many others withoutany antipathy to Swamiji were just taken in by Majumdar\u2019sreputation for holiness, his inspiring eloquence at theParliament, or merely the impression of greatness that wasproduced by his prepossessing appearance \u2014 his wide eyes,straight nose, and flowing beard. What he said about Swamijiwas authoritative, oh, yes, he knew the young man personallyin Calcutta, he wondered why Americans took him seriously,he was a nobody in India, or even in Calcutta to which hebelonged, he was a thug and a cheat \u2014 he had donned themonk\u2019s garb only after he had come to America. Majumdarhad a great success in his campaign of vilification against849Swamiji in America. He so prejudiced President Barrows, saidSwamiji in a letter to Swami Ramakrishnananda that he didnot even speak to him decently.When Majumdar returned to Calcutta, his ears burned atthe words of praise for Swami Vivekananda that he heard dailyeverywhere, even in his own circle, for he found the editor ofThe Indian Mirror, Narendra Nath Sen, who happened to be arelation of his too, to be one of the most enthusiastic supportersof Swamiji. One could not have blamed him much, as one couldnot blame also the orthodox and bigoted among the Christiansin America, if he had from his own point of view, criticizedsome of Swamiji\u2019s views, which genuinely perturbed sincereBrahmos. The old man, however, shied at that kind of work \u2014he did not have, perhaps, much competence for it: he couldinspire people by his eloquence, but he was not an adept inpolemics. In his fury, he sought to destroy Swami Vivekanandaby smirching his character with deadly calumny. He had playedthe game fairly successfully in America, because he had posedthere as one who knew him intimately in India. He hoped tosucceed equally well in India too \u2014 here speaking as one whohad just returned from America and so was in full and firsthandknowledge of \u201cfacts\u201d. As we learn from Swamiji\u2019s letter toMary Hale, 18 March 1894, he was broadcasting thatVivekananda was \u201ccommitting every sin under the sun inAmerica \u2014 especially `unchastity\u2019 of most degraded type\u201d.In one of his earliest meetings with Sri Ramakrishna,the latter had asked the young Naren, \u201cWorldly people oftenspeak ill of those who live in God. When an elephant goes hisway along a road, curs and other animals run after him, yappingand snapping at his heels. He takes no notice of them. Suppose,my child, people speak evil of you behind your back, whatAMERICAN  AND INDIAN SLANDERERSSWAMI VIVEKANANDA850would you do?\u201d The boy had immediately replied, scornfully,\u201cI should regard them as the curs barking at my heels\u201d. \u201cNo,my child\u201d the Master had observed, smilingly, \u201cYou shouldnever go so far as that! God dwells in all things, animate andinanimate. So all things deserve our respect\u201d. The reaction ofSwami Vivekananda to the lies that were being spread againsthim by Majumdar and by some American women and themissionaries, which came to his knowledge a little later, wasworthy of Sri Ramakrishna\u2019s faithful disciple. He was too wellknown as to his character in his native land, he wrote to MaryHale in the same letter we have quoted from above, and hisbrothers and lifelong companions, added he, knew him too wellto believe such \u201ctrash\u201d. His predominant feeling was one ofpity for Majumdar \u201cthat he should stoop so low\u201d. \u201cLord blessthe old boy \u2014 women of America know better of me, I hope,\u201dsaid he. He wrote in the same strain to Alasinga while speakingabout Majumdar\u2019s activities in his letter to him dated 9 April1894. That the sentiment he expressed in these letters forMajumdar came from his heart is borne out by his furtherobservations on the subject in a letter he wrote to Prof. Wrightabout a month later. \u201cThe fever of jealousy which attackedMajumdar,\u201d said he, \u201cgave me a terrible shock, and I pray thathe would know better \u2014 for he is a great and good man whohad tried all his life to do good. But this proves one of myMaster\u2019s sayings \u2014 `living in a room covered with black soot\u2014however careful you may be \u2014 some spots must stick toyour clothes\u2019. So \u2014 however one may try to be good and holy\u2014 so long as he is in the world \u2014 some part of his nature mustgravitate downwards\u201d.14American women, as Swamiji wrote to Mary Hale, surelyknew much better of him than to give credence to the tales ofthe scandalmongers \u2014 at least there were thousands who did851not misunderstand him. Malicious tongues may still havecontinued to wag in America accusing Swamiji of immorality\u2014 it was perhaps impossible to stop them entirely. But afterMrs. Bagley had scotched the reckless lie about Swamiji thatsome women had started in Detroit, by stating actual facts insupport of her refutation of it, they and others like them surelythought many times \u2014 Helen Bagley seems to have been quiteright about them \u2014 before another such lie was invented.Attempts to blacken him seem to have ceased after this \u2014 sofar as our records go at least. In the areas to which Swamiji\u2019sactivities were now shifted he came in contact with powerfulfriends like Mrs. Ole Bull, Mrs. Breed, Miss Phillips and others,whose patronage, though not without some disadvantages, aswe have seen above, presumably gave him protection againstscandalmongers. Through such organizations as the GreenacreConference, the Brooklyn Ethical Association, etc., in whosework he now actively participated, he himself came to be betterknown to many souls in genuine quest for God. He came to beless of a controversial figure now than he had been at Detroit,and his character as a spiritual leader and World Teacher wasnow gradually recognized.Though Majumdar had better success in running downSwamiji in some other directions, as we shall see presently,his attacks on Swamiji\u2019s moral character did not carry him far.Indians \u2014 and specially Bengalis \u2014 had been roused by SwamiVivekananda\u2019s triumphs at the Parliament of Religions and hissubsequent activities in America. At the time when the nationlay helpless under the heels of the foreign conqueror, he hadmade the West realize (so they thought) that however poor andweak in the material sense they were, India stood at the headof the world in matters spiritual. In Bengal, at least, the nameof Vivekananda was now a household word and there was aAMERICAN  AND INDIAN SLANDERERSSWAMI VIVEKANANDA852renewed interest in the life and teachings of his Master, whowas being daily recognized by an increasing number of devoutpeople as an incarnation of God. Men came to learn more andmore about the holy life that had centred round him atDakshineswar, and the Alambazar Math, at which his directdisciples were so long passing their days in poverty and neglect,now came to be a place of pilgrimage for many. Pictures ofSwami Vivekananda on his way to the Parliament adorned thewalls of many homes along with those of Sri Ramakrishna andthe Holy Mother (as they do now all over India). Pamphletswere written on Swamiji\u2019s life containing high praise for hisintellectual and spiritual attainments which were eagerly readby thousands. When Swamiji received one such work, heblushed to read it and, as we know from his letter to IsabelleMcKindley (26 April 1894), he refused to send it over to her.Majumdar\u2019s vilification of his personal character hadcome to his knowledge much earlier but, as we learn from hisletter to Mary Hale, quoted from by us above, it had left himunperturbed. The knowledge that his countrymen in Bengalheld him in high regard gave him satisfaction, but lately a fearhad crept into his heart. As he wrote to Isabelle McKindley,\u201cNow I do not care what they even of my own people (he wasreferring to Majumdar and his ilk) say of me \u2014 except for onething. I have an old mother. She has suffered much all her lifeand in the midst of all she could bear to give me up for theservice of God and man; but to have given up the most belovedof her children \u2014 her hope \u2014 to live a beastly immoral life ina far distant country \u2014 as Mazumdar was telling in Calcutta,would have simply killed her. But the Lord is great, none caninjure His children\u201d.15 Here once more we have a glimpse ofSwamiji\u2019s heart \u2014 of an aspect of it that has a special interestfor a biographer. Truly indeed, as the poet Bhavabhuti says,853the hearts of great men are sterner than thunder and softer thanflowers (vajradapi kathorani mriduni kusumadapiLokottaranam chetamsi konu vijnatumarhati.)We do not know whether the calumnies that PratapChandra Majumdar was spreading against Swamiji did reachthe ears of Bhuvaneshwari. But we may be sure that she knewher Mahadeva like son much better than others and can guessthat, if ever any such tale did reach her, she treated it with thescorn that it deserved. Mahendranath Datta heard some of thestories, not, however, those imputing immorality to Swamiji(or, if he did hear them, does not speak about them in theGhatanabali). What he heard of as being said by Majumdarwas mostly that what Swamiji was saying about Hinduism wasnot that religion as it really was, or was practised but a sort ofneo Hinduism, which was the creation of his own imagination.He found the subject being talked about in the drawing roomsof his locality and Hindu opinion as being much inflamedagainst the Brahmos, who were accused of siding withMajumdar against Swamiji out of sectarian feeling. He narratessome stories of heated arguments, in the course of whichrespectable gentlemen of opposing camps, among them hisneighbour, Rajmohan Bose, almost came to blows \u2014 so greatwas the passion roused. The Brahmos generally had the worstof such encounters \u2014 specially  because Narendra Nath Sen,the editor of the Indian Mirror, one of the leading dailies in theEnglish language edited by an Indian, published faithful andglowing accounts of Swamiji\u2019s activities in America andenabled people to judge things for themselves. Mr. Sen, thougha relation of Majumdar, criticized the latter in his presencebefore the people who thronged his drawing room daily, fortelling lies about Swamiji. He said that out of envy he wasindulging in activities that harmed a noble youth of BengalAMERICAN  AND INDIAN SLANDERERSSWAMI VIVEKANANDA854who was striving, in a far-off country and against many odds,to raise the prestige of the motherland and its culture beforeforeigners.16 In an editorial, entitled \u201cThe Great Hindu inAmerica,\u201d on 8 August 1894, the Indian Mirror referred to thescandalmongering by the missionaries and their Hindu allies,and commented as follows, \u201cIf the missionary critics have anyexcuse, there is none for those Hindus who have either initiatedor joined a league to harm a man who has done so much toraise the Hindu race and their religion so high in the estimationof so large a section of Christendom. We can have no feelingsbut those of contempt for such Hindus as have grown jealousof Swami Vivekananda and his monumental work in America\u201d.Checked at home, Majumdar\u2019s propaganda againstSwamiji, nevertheless, did him great harm in America. Indianswere overjoyed at his success in the Parliament of Religionsand they eagerly followed his subsequent triumphant course inmany American cities. Glowing reports of these activitiesappeared in the Indian newspapers, and his friends sometimessent clippings from them to him. In a letter to IsabelleMcKindley on 26 April 1894, Swamiji said that he had receivedby the latest mail from India a little pamphlet published inCalcutta which contained extracts from American and Indianpapers and magazines about himself in a \u2018strain so fulsome\u2019(they called him \u2018illustrious, wonderful and all sorts ofnonsense\u2019, he said) that he refused to send it over to her.However gratifying to him personally, these appreciations weremostly from individuals to an individual, between them andhimself (as he wrote to a Madrasi disciple on 28 June 1894)and were not public acknowledgements of the Hinducommunity which he represented in America and, in any casedid not reach the American public. On the other hand, as hesaid in the same letter, whatever the Christian missionaries in855India wrote in their papers against him as also the propagandacarried on by the Brahmos and the Theosophists which wasquickly embodied in these reports, \u2014 for they worked hand inhand with each other, \u2014 was regularly published in theAmerican press.At first, it seems, Swamiji did not think very seriouslyabout the propaganda that was being carried on against him byMajumdar and others. He was perhaps unaware of Majumdar\u2019scollusion with the Christian missionaries in India and unableto estimate their total effect in the shape of repercussions inAmerica. In a letter to Swami Ramakrishnananda, dated 19March 1894 (see above, Chapter 8, Section V) he wrote in aspirit of supreme unconcern in respect of Majumdar\u2019spropaganda during the Parliament days, though it is quite clearthat he was fully aware of its omnibus character. \u201cThe Guru iswith me,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt matters little what Majumdar says.Americans love and respect me \u2014 pay my expenses, considerme as their guru. What can Majumdar do? What can the padresdo? Americans are a nation of scholars. There was a time whensuch talks as, `We marry our widows, we do not worship idols,\u2019had some effects. Now they cut little ice, except among thepadres alone. Americans want philosophy, learning; empty talksno longer do\u201d.17 He wrote in the same strain to Mary Hale on18 March 1894, \u201cI am sorry for poor M \u2014 that he should stoopso low! Lord bless the old boy!\u201d18 Three weeks later, however,he wrote a letter to Alasinga (9 April 1894), which shows thathe had realized the harm that Majumdar\u2019s propaganda wasdoing and that he was thinking of some measures forcounteracting it. He asked him, if possible, (italics ours) tohave a meeting convened at Madras to be presided over by theRaja of Ramnad, or some such big person, in which a resolutioncould be passed expressing the entire satisfaction of the HinduAMERICAN  AND INDIAN SLANDERERSSWAMI VIVEKANANDA856community of Madras, who had sent him to represent them atthe Parliament, with the work that he had done there. He wantedthat the meeting should be as large as possible and attended byas many \u201cbig bugs\u201d as may be persuaded to do so. He alsosuggested that letters from the Maharaja of Mysore, the Rajaof Khetri, the Dewan of Junagarh and other such big personages,approving the meeting and its purpose, should be read there.He thought that a similar meeting might be convened in Calcuttaby Girish Chandra Ghosh and Mr. Mitra (Mahendra Mitra,brother of Suren Mitra?), aided by his gurubhais. He alsosuggested that he should ask them, if they could do so, to passthe same resolution as in Madras. He specifically instructedthat copies of the resolution passed at the Madras meetingshould be sent to the editors of the Chicago Herald, theInteroceanic, the New York Sun and the Commercial advertiserof Detroit and to Dr. Barrows, the Chairman of the Parliamentof Religions, Chicago.Alasinga and his friends seem to have already bestirredthemselves in the matter, \u2014 as we shall see presently, though,being men of small means and not of high station in life, theytook some time to actualize their plans. It seems that Swamijialso did not give further attention to the matter for quite sometime \u2014 presumably because meanwhile his home mail hadbrought him some reassuring documents. They included abooklet of extracts from laudatory notices of himself and hisAmerican work in Indian magazines (referred to by us above)and a nice letter from the Dewansaheb of Junagarh, whichproved, as he wrote to Isabelle McKindley (26 April 1894),that for once the prophet had been honoured in his own country.One of the extracts was from the Indian Mirror, whose editor,he gleefully pointed out to Isabelle, was a near relation of theslanderer, Majumdar, \u201cNow\u201d, wrote he, \u201cI do not care what857they even of my own people say about me,\u201d his only remainingworry being that those slanders might reach the ears of hislong suffering, old mother. That Swamiji\u2019s anxieties about themischief making activities of his enemies at home wasconsiderably lessened at this time is shown also by the factthat, in a long letter that he wrote to Alasinga more than amonth and a half later, on 26 May 1894, there is no furtherreference to, or any reminder about his suggestion for a meetingat Madras. As a matter of fact, in this letter, he even wrote, \u201cIhave had enough appreciation in my own country\u201d.19But his enemies had not slackened in their endeavoursto bring him down in the estimation of his admirers at homeand abroad. The result of their concerted efforts was thepublication, on 16 May 1894, in the Boston Daily Advertiser,of an article, entitled, A Prophet from India, which wassubsequently quoted in many other magazines, including theDetroit Free Press, which reproduced it word for word on 11June 1894. The article in the Boston paper contained extractsfrom some journals in India, such as the Christian Patriot, theIndian Evangelical Review, and the Unity and the Ministerwhich sought to prove that Swamiji was an imposter and thathis interpretation of Hinduism was false. In justice to the BostonDaily Advertiser it must be said that on the very next day (17May 1894), it published a letter from an anonymouscorrespondent, who subscribed as \u201cS\u201d and challenged thepretensions of the magazines to give a true interpretation ofHinduism. \u201cS\u201d pointed out that they were all Christianmagazines with the exception of the Unity and the Minister,which was edited by Mr. Majumdar who, too, representedBrahmoism \u201cand not Hinduism in any of its `phases\u2019 and`sects\u2019\u201d. It was wise of \u201cS\u201d to do so, because, as we know fromSwamiji\u2019s letter to the Dewan of Junagarh, 20 June 1894, 20A TRYING TIME FOR SWAMIJISWAMI VIVEKANANDA858Americans in general thought that Indian was Indian and they\u201cknew little the difference between Christian and Hindu\u201d. \u201cS\u201dfurther pointed out that the quotations were attacks on \u201cHindu\u201dpapers, specially the Indian Mirror, and the Bengali, \u201cfor theirpraising Vivekananda and fully indorsing his views\u201d. He alsosent two quotations from two of the leading magazines ofCalcutta, the Indian Mirror and the Amrita Bazar Patrikaasserting that Swami Vivekananda gave a true view ofHinduism. \u201cS\u201d concluded his letter with the remark, \u201cSo it isclear the `Hindus\u2019 all acknowledge him. He never pretends torepresent `Christianity\u2019 or `Brahmo Samaj\u2019.\u201dWe need not go much into the details of the criticisms ofthe Christian papers that the Boston Daily Advertiser quotedfrom. They were mainly such as we are already familiar with,being on the lines along which Christian missionary propagandawas directed against Swamiji since the very days of theParliament. It may suffice to quote as a sample just one sentenceof the Indian Evangelical Review here, \u201cWhat he (Swamiji)taught as Hinduism and what gave power and influence to hiswords was the large admixture of Christian truth which hetaught and which he received as a student in one of the Christianmissionary Colleges of Calcutta, and truth too which is thevery opposite of the error which is the foundation stone of theHinduism which he professed to teach, viz., (1) the brotherhoodof man and (2) the Lordship of God over the conscience\u201d. Thenew note struck in Christian criticisms of Swamiji at this timewas the allegation that he was not a true monk but simply \u201cBabuNarendra Nath Dutt\u201d, son of the late \u201cBabu Tarah Nath Dutt\u201dand a graduate of the Calcutta University who had only veryrecently taken to ascetic life. As we have seen, it was Majumdarwho had started giving the world this new \u201cfact\u201d about Swamiji,but it remains unexplained how he could not supply his859Christian allies in the campaign against Swamiji even thecorrect name of his father. The paragraph from his own paper,the Unity and the Minister that the Boston Daily Advertiserquoted from was also little more than an elaboration in badtaste of this \u201caccusation\u201d. In his attempt to damn \u201cthe NeoHindu Babu Narendra Nath Dutt alias Vivekhananda\u201d(misspelling the word), he recalled that he had once sang hymnsat one of the Brahmo Samajas in Calcutta and also acted onthe stage of the Naba Brindaban Theatre. The new light that hethrew on Swamiji\u2019s antecedents was intended to show him in\u201chis true colours\u201d as a lighthearted Bohemian youth who hadonly recently donned the monk\u2019s garb. We do not know if this\u201crevelation\u201d concerning Swamiji\u2019s past did damn Swamiji inAmerican eyes, but it has certainly discredited Majumdarhimself so far at least as posterity is concerned. He standscondemned for deliberately misrepresenting the NabaBrindaban episode, dealt with by us more fully in a precedingChapter, by suppressing the fact that his own master, KeshubChandra Sen himself, had been one of the actors in that show,which had nothing \u201cBohemian\u201d about it, to say the least.The letter of \u201cS\u201d must have gone a long way to showthat Swamiji was acknowledged by the \u201cHindus\u201d but it stillleft Majumdar\u2019s other accusations, viz., that he had beenassociated with the Brahmo Samaj \u2014 by implication that hewas a renegade Brahmo \u2014 and that he was not a true sannyasi,to be disproved. Swamiji was anxious to think what effectsthese accusations might have on the minds of his Americanfriends and supporters, particularly Prof. Wright who had beenchiefly instrumental in getting him admitted to the Parliamentas a delegate of Hinduism. As a sannyasi he thought he shouldnot defend himself, but he felt he was morally bound to satisfyProf. Wright that his trust in him had not been unwarranted. ItA TRYING TIME FOR SWAMIJISWAMI VIVEKANANDA860is not likely that Prof. Wright was misled by Majumdar\u2019spropaganda, or felt that he had been duped by Swamiji. Butsince in any case he was not likely to ask Swamiji to explainhis position and remove any doubts that might have crossedhis mind, Swamiji felt that he must make the move himself toclarify his position.We have two letters written by Swamiji to Prof. Wrightat this time, the later one written from Chicago on 24 May1894 and the first one written from Boston earlier in the month,the exact date not being ascertainable. It seems that, even beforethe first letter had been written, there had been somecorrespondence between the two, there being a reference atthe very beginning of the letter to his having already sent theProfessor a pamphlet and some letters (which could be no otherthan the ones he had referred to in his letter to IsabelleMcKindley). He makes special mention of the fact that one ofhis correspondents was the Dewan of a princely State in India,who had an all India stature, since he was lately a member ofthe Royal Commission on opium. There was also a letter fromthe Raja of Khetri, dated 7 February 1894, urging him tocontinue his great work in America. While these letters provedup to the hilt that he was no cheat, Swamiji, obviously desiringto confirm what he must have told Prof. Wright about himselfwhen they had first met, asserted in this letter that he was not aprofessional missionary, nor ever would be one, that his placewas in the Himalayas, and that it was because he had the \u201cFad\u201din his head that he had come to America. He said further (andthis is of considerable historical interest) that when his friendsin India had asked him to go to America to represent the Hindureligion in the World\u2019s Parliament, he had refused to do so andthat he had agreed to be sent only when they left it to himselfwhether or not he should join the Parliament. Prof. Wright could861thus feel sure (if really he had come to entertain any doubtsabout it) that the reluctance that Swamiji had first shown aboutgoing back to Chicago to join the Parliament had been a genuineone and that he did go only when he was persuaded to thinkthat it would help his \u201ccause\u201d. There is a hint in this letter thathe had joined the Parliament because he thought it might helprelieve the misery of his countrymen, and that he had now cometo the conclusion that he had failed. In the second letter Swamijiclarified his position vis-\u00e0-vis the Brahmo Samaj (about whichso much was being said by Majumdar) and its leaders and alsogave his views on its doctrines and claims. This letter is ofconsiderable interest to us because we know from it definitelythat he had a poor opinion of the Brahmo religion, that he didnot regard Keshub Chandra Sen and Pratap Chandra Majumdaras sincere, and that he seriously differed from Pandit SivanathSastri on religious matter. He thought that the Brahmo Samajhad done its work, which was social reform, and died (itsreligion was not worth a cent). \u201cI am not sorry neither gladthat it died,\u201d said he.These letters to Prof. Wright seem to have been writtento him with a view to removing from his mind any doubt thathe may have had, in view of Majumdar\u2019s \u2018revelations\u2019 ofSwamiji\u2019s antecedents, that what Swamiji had told him abouthimself was not correct. Prof. Wright had now enough evidencethat there had been no false statements, or even purposefulsuppression of truth in what Swamiji had stated about himself,or about the object of his coming to America when, withoutintroduction or credentials, he had first met him. One feelssure that this high-minded gentleman had never had any doubtsin his mind about his friend\u2019s bona fides and now, after Swamijihad gone out of his way to afford him every satisfaction (as hesaid) from a sense of moral obligation, his respect for him mustA TRYING TIME FOR SWAMIJISWAMI VIVEKANANDA862have, if one may say so, been vastly increased. In reply, Prof.Wright must have reassured Swamiji on the points that hadbeen recently raised in the Boston Daily Advertiser. It is a pitywe have not got these letters of his to Swamiji. However, sofar as Swamiji was himself concerned, the thought that he musthave succeeded in satisfying his friend seems to have restoredto his own mind its usual peace. In a letter he wrote to Alasingaonly four days later, as we have said above, he forgot thecavillers at home and even the suggestion that he had made inhis previous letter about a public meeting at Madras. The notehe struck in this letter was entirely different: he made a stirringcall to his disciples and friends for dedication and sacrifice,for work and service. A few lines quoted from it show the mood,\u201cGreat things can be done by great sacrifices only. . . Work,work the idea, the plan, my brave, noble good souls \u2014 to thewheel, to the wheel put your shoulders. . . The Lord\u2019s blessingson you all. His power be in you all \u2014 as I believe it is already.. . . The spirit, my boys, the spirit: the love, my children, thelove: the faith, the belief; and fear not. The greatest sin is fear.. . . India must rise, and the poor are to be made happy. . . . Theflood of spirituality has risen. I see it is rolling over the landresistless, boundless, and all absorbing\u201d.The respite was brief. As we have said above, the BostonDaily Advertiser article of 16 May 1894 was reproduced wordfor word in the Detroit Free Press of 11 June 1894. With thispublication the storm broke over Swamiji\u2019s head in all its fury.Detroit was a sensitive place for anything concerning Swamiji,having been a chief center of his activities earlier in the year.His enemies there avidly pounced upon the saucy dish thuspresented to them, while his friends, not having before themeven the partial contradiction from \u201cS\u201d that the Advertiser hadquickly published, were bewildered. Mrs. Bagley read the863article, and not being in possession of any facts with which todisprove the allegations, simply sent it on to Swamiji. Prof.Wright also may have drawn Swamiji\u2019s attention to thepublication, since we find Swamiji forwarding to him somemore letters received by him from India, with apologies forthe delay in doing so. In the forwarding letter, dated 18 June1894, Swamiji wrote further as follows, \u201cMrs. Bagley seemsto be unsettled by that article in the Boston paper against me.She sent me over a copy from Detroit and has ceasedcorrespondence with me. Lord bless her. She has been verykind to me. . . . Stout hearts like yours are not common, mybrother\u201d.21One readily understands how, under the circumstances,Swamiji misconstrued Mrs. Bagley\u2019s silence and one also feelssure that it hurt him deeply. At about this time Mrs. Bagley hadplanned to spend the summer at Annisquam and she had invitedSwamiji also to be her guest there. Swamiji would have hadsome good comfort if Mrs. Bagley had sent him a line of cheerwhen she forwarded the newspaper article to him, or writtento him. But, on her side, she too may have been waiting for areply to her letter inviting him to Annisquam and was perhapsnot writing another letter because she expected that they wouldbe meeting each other soon. It is also possible that she was toobusy making arrangements for her journey to Annisquam to beable to write to him. In any case, she had as stout a heart asanybody\u2019s and at the very time when Swamiji was doubtingwhether she continued to be the same to him was giving enoughproof of it in busying herself with writing the earlier of her twofamous letters in defence of her friend. As we have said above,a friend of hers had written to her, presumably on learning thatshe had invited Swamiji to be her guest at Annisquam, warningher about him. The chief allegation that this friend had madeA TRYING TIME FOR SWAMIJISWAMI VIVEKANANDA864against Swamiji, it seems, was that he was a man of intemperatehabits, in proof of which she had possibly narrated stories abouthis improper behaviour in parties given to him in clubs andprivate homes during his stay at Detroit. Mrs. Bagley, who hadbeen Swamiji\u2019s host twice at Detroit and had come to knowhim at close quarters, was in a much better position to contradictthe lies that were obviously circulated about Swamiji\u2019sintemperance. \u201cIn my family he will be always welcome,\u201ddeclared Mrs. Bagley in this letter which was a slap on thecheek of anyone who might advise her to the contrary, orthought ill of Swamiji.We are sure our readers are in no need of our mentioningto them the fact that Swamiji never touched liquor, but it isworth while emphasizing that he did not have the mentality ofa stern prohibitionist, who considered one addicted to drinkingto be a mortal sinner, who ought to be shunned like a leper. AtDetroit, as we have seen, he was a guest of Mr. Palmer, whowas too well-known in the city as a lover of his \u201chot Scotch\u201dand founder patron of his \u201cold boys\u2019 club\u201d, all members ofwhich shared his love for that \u201chot\u201d substance. It will not beunreasonable to suppose that at the time some peopleunthinkingly judged Swamiji by the company he kept, andsurely his enemies found in it a ready handle for concoctinglies about him. For yet another reason some peoplemisunderstood Swamiji, and it is worthwhile mentioning it inthis connection. Handsome in appearance, always well-groomed, and cheerful in countenance, Swamiji presented astriking contrast to the frail, wan, morose looking personagethat the average Westerner had a mental picture of as a man ofreligion. It is possible that some people who saw Swamijiattending dinner parties, etc. at Detroit were genuinely shockedto find him mixing with other guests on terms of familiarity865instead of assuming the standoffish pose of a high churchdignitary. Then, Swamiji had certain habits which made himopen to criticism, such as smoking, magnified in the Unity andthe Minister article referred to above as \u201csmoking endlesscigars\u201d and repeated by others in the West. Later, some Englishdisciples of Swamiji found other grounds to complain of,besides smoking \u201cdollar cigars\u201d, such as his alleged fondnessfor good food, or indulging in luxuries, etc., that wereconsidered by them as quite unworthy of a sannyasi. No doubtall these charges against Swamiji were either lies, or grossexaggerations, as Swamiji maintained in a letter, November,1899, to Mr. Sturdy, an English disciple who broke off hisrelations with him for a time on certain misconceptions as someof the above.22 Asked by a disciple once why he always put ona cheerful \u2014 even a merry \u2014 look, supposed to be unbecomingof a holy man, Swamiji had replied, \u201cWhy shall I be morose?We are sons of bliss\u201d. With all that, he was often misunderstood,with the result that his detractors could find many persons whomthey could gull into believing even the wildest tales that theymanufactured about him.Mrs. Bagley\u2019s strong letter to her Detroit friend rejectingthe accusations contained in the tales that were being circulatedabout Swamiji and upholding him as \u201ca strong, noble, humanbeing \u2014 one who walks with God\u201d, must have checked thecampaign of vilification at that city. But Swamiji knew nothingabout the action that Mrs. Bagley had taken to defend him, andwas indeed under the impression that she had deserted him. Atthe time, moreover, he was less concerned with the vilificationat Detroit \u2014 possibly also he knew little about it yet \u2014 andwas preoccupied with and sorely distressed because of theMajumdar cum Christian missionary controversy with whichthe Detroit Free Press issue of 11 June was overloaded, viz.,A TRYING TIME FOR SWAMIJISWAMI VIVEKANANDA866that he was not a genuine sannyasi, or a real Hindu but was afraud and an imposter. At the time when Swamiji first came toknow about the pranks that Majumdar was playing in Calcutta,he did not, as we have pointed out, take them too seriously.His chief concern then was that his friends should notmisunderstand him and, accordingly, he had written to Prof.Wright. He had also thought of some long-term measures and,as we have seen, suggested to Alasinga (9 April 1894) that apublic meeting be held in Madras and a resolution expressingthe satisfaction of the Hindu community with his work passedand sent to Dr. Barrows and some editors of American papers.At the time apparently he was satisfied that his suggestionswould be acted upon in due course, and in his next letter toAlasinga, written more than a month and a half later, (25 May1894), made no further reference to them.His equanimity did not last long and, as his letters to theDewan Sahib of Junagarh (20 June 1894) and to a Madrasidisciple (28 June 1894) show, he had already begun to viewthe matter differently. Certain happenings conspired to forcehim to do so and the result was that he was thrown into thedeepest trough of mental depression. The phase of his rethinkingseems to have started with the knowledge that his enemieswere still aiming their poisoned darts at him, a fresh evidenceof which was the reproduction by the Detroit Free Press in itsissue of 11 June 1894 of the article of the Boston DailyAdvertiser of about a month ago. He perhaps got a copy of thispaper from Mrs. Bagley, who did not write to him for sometime after she had dispatched it to him, it seems, withoutcomments, Swamiji was deeply distressed at her silence andthought that it showed that she had deserted him. Also perhapsthinking that, likewise, Prof. Wright might have becomedifferent to him, he again wrote to him, forwarding to him at867the same time some more letters he had received from Indiathat proved his bona fides. What pained him most at this timewas, however, the thought that Alasinga and his friends haddeserted him too and that Indians, who were loud individuallyin praising him, were collectively too inept to be able to helphim \u2014 even if that did not require more than a \u201cfew empty\u201dwords to be sent up to some addresses in America.As the events proved, his apprehensions were wrong,and one would have described the whole episode as a comedyof errors, if it were not for the very sad fact that for nearly twomonths he was in deep mental anguish. The position in whichhe found himself at this time is described in his own words inthe two letters (to the Dewan Saheb on 20 June 1894 and to aMadrasi disciple on 28 June 1894) that we have referred toabove. The missionaries were always busy picking up anythingsaid against him in the Christian papers of India and publishingthem in America. The average American, not knowing thedistinction between the Christian and the Hindu papers, thoughtthat the criticisms were made by his own people (the Hindus).The missionary enemies of Swamiji in America went from doorto door to make his friends give him up and with the jealousyof the Hindu residents (Brahmos and Theosophists) to backthem, largely succeeded in their game. So far as reception went,said Swamiji, the propaganda against him had little effect onthe American nation. But so far as helping him with funds wasconcerned, said he, it had a terrible effect in making them takeoff their helping hands from him.As Swamiji viewed the affair, his difficulties stemmedfrom the fact that he had come to America without \u201ccredentials\u201dand that though nearly a year had passed since he had come,nothing had been done by Indians to affirm that he representedA TRYING TIME FOR SWAMIJISWAMI VIVEKANANDA868them and to make Americans aware of the fact. Of course,Indians all over India had acclaimed his success in theParliament and individuals had written to him highly praisinghim and informing him that he was being highly praised inIndia. \u201cBut that is,\u201d as he wrote to his Madrasi disciple, 28June 1894, \u201cbetween you and me, for I never saw a single Indianpaper writing about me, except for the three square inches sentto me by Alasinga. . . Indian Hindu papers may laud me to theskies, but not a word of that ever came to America. . . Morethan two months ago I wrote to Alasinga about this. He did noteven answer my letter. I am afraid his heart has grownlukewarm\u201d. The case would have been different, thought he, ifresolutions had been passed in public meetings in Madras andCalcutta and sent on to America, as he had suggested. \u201cEverymoment I expected something from India. No, it never came.Last two months especially I was in torture at every moment.No, not even a newspaper from India. My friends waited,waited, month after month; nothing came, not a voice. Manyconsequently grew cold and at last gave me up\u201d. \u201cI stand afraud in this country,\u201d he roundly declared.Swamiji had some hard words to say about his Madrasidisciples and about Indians in general who, he thought, hadfailed him. It was foolish of him, said he, that, relying on them,he came to America. Referring in particular to the suggestionthat he had made for the holding of public meetings, he hadfound at his cost that it was too terrible a task for India toundertake. \u201cBoobies,\u201d said he, \u201cwho cannot get up a fewmeetings of 50 men each and send up a few empty words onlyto help me, talk big about influencing the world\u201d. Hecomplained that his brethren (presumably his gurubhais inCalcutta) were foolishly talking nonsense about KeshubChandra Sen and that the \u201cMadrasi babies\u201d were telling the869Theosophists anything he wrote about them and thereby onlycreating his enemies. He, however, remained \u201ceternally\u201dgrateful to the Madrasi young men who, he said, had done morefor him than he deserved and more than was in their power.\u201cMay the Lord bless them forever\u201d. He did not blame anyonebut himself for the position in which he found himself. \u201cAfterall, I must work my karma out,\u201d he declared. He had foundAmerica to be the best field in the world for carrying on hisidea, and so there was no question of his leaving it soon. \u201cIhave launched my boat in the waves, come what may,\u201d hedeclared.As we have said above, his friends in India, particularlythose of Madras, had not really deserted him and, as we shallpresently see, the latter had organized a great meeting in Madrason 28 April 1894, that is, even before his own suggestion tothem as contained in his letter to Alasinga of 9 April had reachedthem. It needs also to be said that his own position in Americawas not so hopeless, or his prospects so bleak as he thoughtthey were and represented them to be in these two letters. Atthe very time when he was doubting Mrs. Bagley\u2019s attitude tohim, that lady, as we have seen, was writing a stiff letter to herfriend, who had carried some tales about him to her. If \u201cmany\u201dfriends had given him up, we may be sure that they returned tohim, as had happened on some previous occasions. The letterof \u201cS\u201d shows that Americans were not so completely in thedark about Swamiji\u2019s standing in his own country as he fearedthat they were. As regards the monetary question also, it doesnot really seem that either the hostility of his American enemies,or the supposed apathy of his Indian friends affected his positionvery seriously, or, at any rate, for long. It seems that in June,1894, when there was widespread labour unrest and Chicagowas in turmoil, Swamiji had few lecture engagements and thatA TRYING TIME FOR SWAMIJISWAMI VIVEKANANDA870consequently he had not been able to add anything to the fundthat he was building up for his work in India. This may havemade him anxious and may account for his statement (in hisletter to Mr. Desai) that Americans had taken off their helpinghands from him. But in the same letter and the same contexthe had ascribed the fact in part to the prevailing economicdepression in America. And how much, after all, had he receivedfrom Americans as gifts for the work in India? Even in normaltimes, his fund was being reared up mostly on his savings fromhis own hard-earned money and comparatively little on\u201cgenerous\u201d American contributions. In a letter dated 21September 1894 Swamiji warned Alasinga, \u201cThere is no hopefor money for our project here. No large number of men dogood out of mere sympathy. The few who really give money inthe Christian lands often do so through priest craft and fear ofhell. So it is in our Bengali proverb, `Kill a cow and make apair of shoes out of the leather and give them in charity to aBrahmana\u2019. So it is here and everywhere; and the Westernersare miserly in comparison to our race. I sincerely believe thatthe Asians are the most charitable race in the world, only theyare very poor\u201d.23 Even at this time, when Swamiji was sufferingfrom mental depression, he was confident about his ability tohold on in America. That his spirit was as lofty as ever is provedby his letter to Mary and Harriet Hale on 26 June, expressinghis utmost reliance on God: \u201cThou music of my Beloved\u2019s flute,lead on, I am following\u201d.24Be that as it may, a great public meeting was held atPachayappa\u2019s Hall, Madras on Saturday, 28 April 1894, toexpress to Swamiji the grateful thanks of the citizens for hisrepresentation of them at the Parliament of Religions. Thismeeting, as we have pointed out above, came about as the resultof a spontaneous move by Swamiji\u2019s disciples, Swamiji\u2019s letter871dated 9 April  suggesting such a meeting not having yet reachedthem. This fact disposes of a criticism leveled against Hindusgenerally by a recent writer to the effect that they failedpromptly to take united and official action to acknowledgepublicly the champion of their country and to thank theAmerican people for their reception of him.25 Unfortunately,the writer has gone further in condemning Swamiji\u2019scountrymen by observing that this failure of theirs was due to\u201cthe inertia\u201d that had been produced by their centuries ofsubjugation under foreign rule. It is likely that these accusationswould not have been made if the writer were aware at the timeof writing that the meeting was held not so late as it was believedat the time, viz., sometime in June, but on 28 April. Be that asit may, one may find that many factors other than allegednational inertia were responsible for the failure of Swamiji\u2019scountrymen publicly and officially to stand by the championof their country. (By the way, Lord Acton has warned studentsof History against attempting to explain historical events byreference to national predilections, such as Britishthoroughness, Spanish indolence, French volatility, etc., towhich one may add Hindu timidity, or inertia.)One has to bear in mind certain facts about conditions inIndia in Swamiji\u2019s times, viz., the end of the nineteenth century,before one assumes the role of a critic of the Indian people.The expression of public opinion had not yet become as vocalthen as it became sometime afterwards and, in any case, theholding of a public meeting on any and every occasion had notyet come into vogue in India. The urgency of holding a publicmeeting to express their support of Swamiji came home to hisdisciples only when his predicament in America came to bemore or less known to them. There were few newspapers inIndia in those days and the more influential among those thatA TRYING TIME FOR SWAMIJISWAMI VIVEKANANDA872existed, being in English, were read only by the educated fewin the country. They gave little news about Swamiji as anyonewho goes through the old files of the papers of those days canfind out for himself. Among the Indian edited papers, it wasprincipally the Indian Mirror, edited by Narendranath Sen,which was always sympathetic to Swamiji and occasionallygive some news about him. The present writer has diligentlygone through the files of this paper in the National Library inCalcutta and has found that in 1894 it had only six editorialson Swamiji. Only in two of these, viz., \u201cSwami Vivekanandain America\u201d, dated Wednesday, 21 February 1894 and \u201cTheGreat Hindu in America\u201d, dated Wednesday, 8 August 1894did he find references to the attacks on Swamiji. The editorstrongly condemned Swamiji\u2019s enemies and his strictures musthave had some effects. The conclusion could not but be drawnthat the general Hindu public, only a small portion of whichthe Indian Mirror and other Indian edited papers could reach,were mostly ignorant of what was happening in distant America.Public reaction to the knowledge of the dangerous situation inwhich Swamiji was finding himself in America was quick andpublic meetings were held all over India to champion him.The public meeting at Madras was held on Saturday, 28April 1894 at 5.30 p.m. and was presided over by DewanBahadur S. Subrahmanya Iyer, C.I.E. and attended, amongothers, by Raja Sir S. Ramasamy Mudaliar, Kt., C.I.E.Sundararama Iyer, B.A.B.L., Mr. Manmathanath Bhattacharya.The Raja of Ramnad sent a telegram. The first resolutionthanking Swamiji for representing India at the Parliament andfor his lucid exposition of Hinduism was moved by Mr.C.Ramchandra Saheb. It was seconded by Mr. Gopal KrishnaMudaliar, Headmaster, Pachayappa School. The next resolutionthanking the American people for the cordial and sympathetic873reception they had accorded the Swami was moved by Mr.M.O. Parthasarathi Iyengar and seconded by Mr. KrishnaswamyIyer. The third resolution requesting the chairman to forwardcopies of the above resolutions to Swamiji and to Dr. Barrowswas proposed by Mr. T. P. Kodanda Rama Iyer, BL., andseconded by Mr. D. R. Balaji Rao, B.A.B.L., Mr. ManmathanathBhattacharya, M.A proposed a vote of thanks to the Chairmanwho, in acknowledging it, said that he would request all thosepresent at the meeting to bear in mind the message of SwamiVivekananda, \u201cHelp and not fight. Assimilation and notdestruction. Harmony and peace, not dissension\u201d.26 Accordingto a report of the meeting that, as we have said above, waspublished in the Boston Evening Transcript on 30 August 1894,the Chairman is said to have further observed as follows: \u201cWhenour fetters break asunder, as they must, with the progress ofgood government and material prosperity we hope that our racewill be able to utilize her national resurrection for the spiritualelevation of the world\u201d. It was in this light, added he, thatIndians viewed the great success of Swamiji\u2019s mission toAmerica and the kindly and enthusiastic reception which thegreat American nation, \u201cin their centers of light, might andfreedom\u201d had accorded to their gifted representative.27The news that a meeting was held at Madras and waspresided over by Dewan Bahadur S. Subrahmanya Iyer,appeared in the Indian Mirror in its issue of 1 May 1894. Butlittle further notice seems to have been taken of it in India andit certainly remained unknown in America till 30 August when,as we have seen above, it was editorially commented on in theBoston Evening Transcript. It appears that it was only sometimein June, 1894, that is, at least after a month after the meetinghad been held and the Chairman had asked the organizers ofthe meeting to send copies of the resolution to Swamiji and toA GREAT PUBLIC MEETING AT MADRASSWAMI VIVEKANANDA874Dr. Barrows, that this was actually done. The result was that,while Americans  continued to be fed with maliciouspropaganda carried on by the missionaries in India which foundready publication in the American press, Swamiji passed hisdays in mental suffering, specially because he suspected thathis friends in India had deserted him. It was not till the firstweek of July, that is, after two months had passed, that Swamijilearned something about the meeting from a letter fromAlasinga which, not having been addressed properly, that is, to541 Dearborn Avenue, and after having \u201ctravelled the wholecountry\u201d to reach him was actually received by him. Even thenit appears that the resolutions had not been to him, or to Dr.Barrows. In his letter dated 9 April, as we have seen, Swamijihad instructed Alasinga to have a meeting held and a resolutionpassed to the effect that he had to their satisfaction representedHinduism. He had actually given Alasinga a list of Americannewspapers together with their addresses to which copies ofthe resolutions were to be sent. The letter must have reachedAlasinga towards the middle of May and it is puzzling how hefailed to take the necessary action though the meeting had inthe meanwhile been held and resolutions passed. It seems thatit was not till Swamiji\u2019s letter to a Madrasi disciple dated 28June containing some bitter comments on the behaviour of hisdisciples, reached them, probably sometime towards the endof July or the beginning of August, that the latter woke up andsent the proceedings of the Madras meeting to Americannewspapers, the earliest to receive them being the BostonEvening Transcript which published them, as soon as received,on 30 August 1894. How the ever faithful Alasinga failed toinform Swamiji in proper time about the meeting, or to sendthe resolutions even as late as when he wrote a wronglyaddressed letter to him, remains without a convincingexplanation. Mahendranath Datta tells us that Alasinga875entrusted a friend with the task of sending the resolutions tothe American newspapers and that the latter kept the papers ina drawer and forgot everything about it.28 Obviously, we donot know the whole story about the episode but surely therewas a grave remissness on somebody\u2019s part. Swamiji\u2019s onlycomment on it (as contained in his letter dated 11 July 1894 toAlasinga) was, \u201cLearn business, my boy. We shall do greatthings yet!\u201d29The report of the Madras meeting was published andeditorialized in the Interoceanic on 31 August 1894 and, amongthe New York papers, in the Sun on 2 September 1894 and inthe Daily Tribune on 3 September 1894. The comments werehighly appreciative, not only of the fact that Swamiji\u2019s effortsin America had been endorsed by the Hindus of Madras, but ofthe spirit lying behind the expression of the gratitude of theIndian people to Americans for the very kind and sympatheticreception which Americans had accorded to Swamiji. TheInteroceanic quoted with particular approval that part of oneof the resolutions of the Madras meeting in which it was statedthat American appreciation of Swamiji\u2019s lofty ideas indicatedthat America was far from the \u201cmotherland of unblushing dollarworship that she was supposed to be\u201d. It went on in this strainto observe as follows: \u201cThe people (Indians) are correctingtheir impressions of America since they have seen it througheyes in which they have confidence as representing themselves,and India through reports of Swami Vivekananda, the greatHindu teacher, will learn to admire the Western world and learnfrom it many things that will improve her material prosperityand welfare, as Americans learned of the spiritual beauties ofHindu philosophy as taught by one of the great Hindu priests\u201d.In thus bringing the East and the West nearer to each otherA GREAT PUBLIC MEETING AT MADRASSWAMI VIVEKANANDA876through Swamiji\u2019s teachings, the Parliament of Religions, saidthe paper, had begun to show its fruits far off in India.As we have said above, the fact that a meeting in supportof Swamiji was held in Madras on 28 April was taken littlenotice of in India and remained wholly unknown in Americatill after four months had passed and the American papers hadreceived the resolutions passed therein and begun to publishthem with editorial comments. But the chief object whichSwamiji had in view when he wanted such a meeting ormeetings to be held, viz., the counteracting of missionarypropaganda against him, was not yet achieved and two moremonths had to pass before this was in any way done. He was atAnnisquam as the guest of Mrs. Bagley (or, more exactly, onthe point of leaving the place at the end of his more than threeweeks\u2019 stay there) when he read about the meeting and theresolutions in the Interoceanic of 31 August 1894. (Curiously,in his letter to Manmathanath Bhattacharya from Annisquamdated 5 September 1894, about which we have spoken inChapter 6, Section X above, there is no mention whatsoever ofthe trial he had just gone through.) The immediate results ofthe great meeting at Madras were thus little. Nor, so far as wecould find out in the newspapers of those days, was it soonfollowed by another similar meeting anywhere in India. (See,however, Chapter 13, Note No. 140, below.) The next suchmeeting that we learn about was not held till 22 August, thatis, after nearly four months had passed, and that was inKumbakonam. It was presided over by Dewan BahadurRaghunath Rao and addressed, among others, by Prof.Rangachary of the local College. The first resolution, thankingSwamiji for his able defence of Hinduism, was proposed byRao Bahadur Seshaya.30877The next such meeting to be held was at Bangalore on27 August. It was held at the Lecture Hall of the Central Collegeat 8 a.m. and was presided over by Sri K. Seshadri Iyer, k.c.s.i.,Dewan of the Mysore State who, as we know, (see Chapter 6,Section X, above), was among the earliest people in South Indiato recognize the genius of Swamiji. Seated by him on the daiswere the Hon\u2019ble Chentsal Rao Pantulu, Councillor to HisHighness the Maharaja of Mysore, Messrs Ramachandra Iyerand Krishnamurti, High Court Judges, Mr. V. P. Madhava Rao,Inspector General of Police and other distinguished men. Beforethe Chairman addressed the meeting, Mr. G. G. Narasimachariar,B.A. gave a sketch of Swamiji\u2019s life. (This was later drawnupon by the Brooklyn Daily Eagle in an account of Swamijithat appeared in that paper on 30 December 1894 on the eve ofSwamiji\u2019s visit to Brooklyn, see Chapter 9, Section VIII below.)Three resolutions were passed, the first to thank Swamiji, thesecond to thank the American people, and the third to ask theChairman to send copies of the resolutions to Swamiji and toDr. Barrows.31 The next meeting to be held was in the TownHall in Calcutta on 5 September 1894, about which we shallspeak in detail presently. (This was preceded by a few days bya private meeting organized by prominent Hindus at Baghbazar,a report of which appeared in the Indian Mirror on 13September.) Sometime after this the Maharaja of Khetri held aDurbar at his palace to thank Swamiji and the American people.Mahendranath Datta says that the meeting at the Town Hall inCalcutta was followed by similar meetings in various places inBengal. He adds that it became now the fashion to hold suchmeetings in province.32The meeting in the Town Hall in Calcutta, though belated,was perhaps the most effective with regard to the purpose whichSwamiji had in view when he had suggested such meetings.A GREAT PUBLIC MEETING AT MADRASSWAMI VIVEKANANDA878\u201cThe acclaim of Calcutta\u201d, as says Mrs. Burke, \u201cvindicatedSwamiji as nothing else could, setting upon him and his workthe official seal of approval with final and indisputable authorityand silencing his enemies once and for all\u201d.33 It was highlysignificant not only because Calcutta was his home and wasthe principal seat of the Majumdar Christian missionaryopposition but because of the thoroughly representativecharacter of the gathering, the largest that had been ever seenin that historic building. The credit for organizing it goes toSwamiji\u2019s gurubhais, and specially to Swami Abhedananda,who, as we have said in a previous Chapter, (Chapter, I, SectionIII above) had the greatest difficulty in even finding a suitableChairman for the meeting. The meeting was attended bymembers of all sections of the community, including thepredominating business community of the Marwaris, all classesand walks of life, viz., the landlords, lawyers, intellectuals and,above all, an impressive body of the orthodox Pandits. Theenthusiasm shown by the last named in applauding Swamijiwas specially effective, because the Pandits\u2019 endorsement ofSwamiji\u2019s exposition of Hinduism gave the lie to the particularcriticism of Swamiji that his opponents banked upon, viz., thatit was not of true Hinduism, i.e., of Hinduism as it really wasand practiced, but was a creation of Swamiji\u2019s brain \u2014 NeoHinduism.The meeting at the Calcutta Town Hall was presided overby Raja Peary Mohan Mukherjee of Uttarpara, a scion of anold aristocratic family of Bengal. Among those who attendedit were Pandit Rajkumar Nyayaratna, MaharajkumarBinoykrishna Deb Bahadur, Guruprasanna Ghosh, Rai BahadurNandalal Bose, Madhusudan Smrititirtha, Ray JatindranathChaudhuri of Taki, the Hon\u2019ble Surendranath Banerjee, Mr.N. N. Ghosh, the editor of the Indian Nation, Mr. Narendranath879Sen, the editor of the Indian Mirror, Dr. J. B. Dally, the editorof the Daily News, Sasibhushan Mukherjee, the editor of theNational Guardian, Amritalal Roy, the editor of the Hope,Bhupendranath Bose, Rai Bahadur Shivdas Bagla, and the RightReverend N. Sadhananda of Ceylon. Messages of support forthe object of the meeting  were received from RajaRajendranarayan Deb Bahadur (son of Raja Sir RadhakantaDeb), Sir Rameshchandra Mitra, and others. Sir GurudasBannerjee, who had declined to preside over the meeting onaccount of orthodoxy (see Chapter 1, Section III), did attendit. Surendranath Banerjee who, as we have seen, had predictedthat Naren would turn out to be a great orator (see Chapter 2)made a short but impressive speech. According toMahendranath Datta who, now a blooming young fellow oftwenty-five, attended the meeting and sent a report of theproceedings to Swami Ramakrishnananda, who was at Madrasat the time, and had requested him to do so, the best speecheswere made by Mr. N. N. Ghosh, Narendranath Sen, ManoranjanGuhathakurta, and Hemendranath Mitra.Three resolutions were unanimously passed at themeeting \u2014 the first recording its grateful appreciation of thegreat services rendered to the cause of Hinduism by SwamiVivekananda; the second thanking Dr. Barrows and Mr. MerwinMarie Snell for the cordial and sympathetic reception accordedby them to Swamiji; and the third requesting the Chairman tosend copies of the resolutions together with that of a letteraddressed to \u201cShreemat Vivekananda Swami\u201d over thesignature of the Chairman to the three persons named in theresolutions. Besides containing an expression of thanks, theletter to Swamiji affirmed the full approval of the Hindus tothe exposition of their religion by him. \u201cNo exposition of thegeneral principles of the Hindu religion,\u201d it said, \u201ccould, withinA GREAT TOWN HALL MEETING AT CALCUTTASWAMI VIVEKANANDA880the limits of a lecture, be more accurate and lucid than whatyou gave in your address to the Parliament of Religions onTuesday, the 19th September, 1893. And your subsequentutterances on the same subject have been equally clear andprecise\u201d. As soon as the meeting was over, Swami Abhedanandasent copies of the resolutions by cable to Swamiji, Rev.Barrows, and Mr. Merwin Marie Snell, and the letter by thenext mail to them and to Swamiji. He collected a fund withwhich he got the proceedings of the meeting and the speechesembodied in a pamphlet, of which 2000 copies were printedand circulated.The words of sympathy and support that his fellowcountrymen sent him \u2014 belated but full-throated \u2014 filled theyoung monk, engaged for about a whole year in preaching thegospel of love and tolerance in an alien, far-off country againstheavy odds, with overwhelming emotions of joy andthankfulness. As could be expected, the first thing that hethought of in this hour of his exaltation was to give his \u201csisters\u201d,the Hale and McKindley girls, a share of the blessedness ofspirit that he had been filled with. \u201cO my sisters,\u201d wrote he,\u201cGlory unto Jagadamba (Mother of the Universe) \u2014 I havegained beyond expectations \u2014 the prophet has been honoured,and with a vengeance. I am weeping like a child at His mercy..Sisters, there is a God \u2014 a father \u2014 Mother \u2014 who neverleaves his children \u2014 never, never, never \u2014 Put uncannytheories aside and becoming children take refuge in Him \u2014 Icannot write more \u2014 I am weeping like a woman\u201d. (Asreproduced in C.W., VIII, 316, the letter is dated New York 9thJuly 1894, which is obviously wrong \u2014 the meeting being heldon 5 September. The letter was probably written on 9 September1894, that is, as soon as the good news was received by him bycable from Swami Abhedananda, the mistake lying only in881naming the month. Since it was an emotional outpouring, it isnot likely that Swamiji held his pen till \u201clate September\u201d, ashas been suggested by a writer, that is, till he received SwamiAbhedananda\u2019s letter. Even if we suppose that he did so, lateSeptember would be too early, since a letter from Calcuttawould take at least a month to reach him. The fact that theletter was written from New York does not present a difficulty,for we know from Swamiji\u2019s  letter to Isabelle McKindley fromAnnisquam on 20 August 189434 that he intended to go thenceto New York or Boston and it now seems probable that he didpay a flying visit to New York.)It seems that the spirit of some of the speeches deliveredin Calcutta was not to the liking of some Americans. In anarticle on 4 May 1895, the Critic, a periodical ordinarilyfavourable to Swamiji, commented on the speechesunfavourably. They showed, said the paper, that the Hindu isin no way behind the American in boasting and conceit, a proofthat the whole world is indeed kin. Swamiji\u2019s critics were notentirely silenced; as we shall see later, they found other groundsfor slandering him. The Rev. Hume who had, as we have seen,claimed him as a fellow countryman, got himself busy attackinghim on the ground, this time, among others, that he wasunorthodox in the matter of food. Swamiji treated the particularaccusation with contempt. After the Calcutta meeting, however,none dared challenge his right to represent the faith he professedand, in any case, the worst was over. In the eastern part of thecountry to which he now transferred his activities, as we havesaid above, he found friends like Mrs. Ole Bull, Dr. Lewis G.Janes and others who recognized that he had a world missionand successfully defended him against slanderers. In a letter toAlasinga dated 6 May 1895 Swamiji spoke on the subject asfollows:\u201d \u201cIf you hear some of the filthy stories the orthodoxA GREAT TOWN HALL MEETING AT CALCUTTASWAMI VIVEKANANDA882men and women invent against me, you will be astonished.Now, do you mean to say a Sannyasin should go about defendinghimself against the brutal and cowardly attacks of these self-seeking men and women? I have some influential friends herewho, now and then, give them their quietus\u201d.35 During the restof his days in America, attacks on him of the kind that we havedealt with above were few, though some venomous tonguesstill wagged; and thousands accepted him as their guru.IIIAs we have said above, though Swamiji spent nearly the wholeof June and perhaps a little of July at Chicago in great mentalunrest, he was by no means forgetful of his life\u2019s mission and,on the contrary, at the very time, was maturing his plans forwork in India. His letters to the Dewan Saheb of Junagarh, 20June 1894, the Maharaja of Mysore, 23 June 1894, and eventhe letter to a Madrasi disciple, 28 June 1894, which was writtenin a mood of desperation, testify to this. In the last-mentionedletter he reaffirmed his resolve to continue his work in Americawhich, he thought, was working for India as well, and in lettersto the Dewan Saheb and the Mysore ruler he outlined aprogramme of work for the uplift of the masses in India. Withoutdoubt also, he was spending these days of respite from travelsand lectures in intensive meditations, as he did at Chicago afterhis strenuous labours at the Parliament. Though we have noinformation that, as at that time, his mind still often verged onlosing itself in the Absolute, he was in a state of great mentalexaltation and blessedness, a taste of which he conveyed toMary and Harriet Hale in his letter to them, 26 June 1894. But,as we have already pointed out earlier, he was sick of lecturingunder tutelage either of professional organizations or of rich883patronesses, and he was finding out a new method of work \u2014a more effective way of imparting spirituality to the materialistWest. At this time a hand beckoned him to a place \u2014 Greenacre\u2014 where he was to acquire a unique experience, which probablyhelped him finally to make up his mind to change over to hisnew plan for work in America.The summer months in America are unsuitable for muchactive work and though, of course, the majority of the peopletoil on in the plains, a few, who can afford it, go to seasideplaces or to hilly resorts, or to Europe, for rest and recreation.Swamiji who, at least for health reasons, badly needed a change,gladly accepted an invitation from Dr. and Mrs. Guernesy who,as we have seen, were very kind to him, to spend some timewith them at Fishkill Landing, a small place on the Hudsonriver in New York State. We do not know when exactly hewent there, or how long he stayed there, since our only sourceof information concerning this visit of his, viz., a letter he wrotefrom there to Mrs. Hale, does not bear the exact date, though itmentions the month, viz., July. Incidentally, it appears that Mrs.Hale\u2019s letter, to which this one was the reply, had a referenceto the Interior, a Presbyterian paper of the \u201cblue nose\u201d varietywhich, as we have said in a previous Chapter, had adverselycommented on his work in the Parliament and which again,perhaps in some recent issue, had repeated its previousperformance. Swamiji, who had had enough of hostile criticismof himself recently, did not welcome this information, as thetone of his reply to Mrs. Hale suggests. He said that he had nothad a copy of the paper and that he was glad at the fact, sinceit could have only roused \u201cbad feelings\u201d towards \u201cthese sweetChristian gentlemen\u201d in his heart and his religion taught himthat anger is a great sin.A GREAT TOWN HALL MEETING AT CALCUTTASWAMI VIVEKANANDA884In the same letter Swamiji said that he had received aninvitation from a very rich lady to be her guest at Swampscott,which he had declined with thanks. He had received some otherinvitations also from some very rich people there, but hadrefused them all, said he. \u201cI am very careful now to take thehospitality of anybody here, specially the rich,\u201d added he; \u201cIhave by this time seen the whole business through\u201d.Nevertheless, from the fact that from this place he wrote to theHale Sisters a letter dated 26 July 189436, we learn that he didvisit Swampscott. It seems that he had yielded to theimportunities of the rich lady and stayed there as her guest.The stay was very pleasant, as here he chanced to meet withsome of his old friends and onetime hosts, such as Miss MaryPhillips and Mrs. Breed. He enjoyed the climate and had many\u201cduckings in the sea like a fish\u201d. No doubt he improvedconsiderably in health and spirits here. The letter also showshim the affectionate, playful, big brother that he was to theHale and McKindley girls. He chided Harriet for the Frenchlessons she had given him (we have spoken about the episodein a previous Chapter), and compared the comfort of coolSwampscott where he was passing his days with the heat ofChicago where his \u201csisters\u201d were condemned to live at themoment. The implication was that their suffering was apunishment for their sin of their wrong teaching of French! Hewrote, \u201cYou are a pack of fools and heathens, I tell you. Nowyou are gasping for breath like a huge fish stranded? I am gladthat you are sizzling. Oh, how nice and cool it is here, and it isincreased a hundredfold when I think about the gasping,sizzling, boiling, frying four old maids, and how cool and niceI am here, Whoooooo!\u201dHe had got over his fit of mental depression completelyand his spirits were soaring. As we learn from this letter, he885was discussing with Miss Phillips a plan for starting a monasteryon a plot of land belonging to her and which she had offered tohim \u2014 somewhere in N.Y., evidently not knowing, or caringto know where exactly it was. There were a \u201cmountain, lake,river, forest altogether \u2014 what more?\u201d He was going to makea Himalayas there, he announced. He was not leaving America,he averred, \u201cwithout throwing one more apple of discord intothis already roaring, fighting, kicking, mad whirlpool ofAmerican religion\u201d. The plan of a Himalayan retreat inAmerica, however, melted in the thin air, as lamentably as hissearch in India for one such had done during his days of rovingas a monk. It materialized long afterwards in the founding ofthe Mayavati Asrama, as we shall see later in this work.Immediately, however, he was to have a taste of somethinglike it, though not high up in the hills but by the side of riverand hills and with nature herself in the thick of a forest. Thishe announced in this letter simply, \u201cI am going to Greenacre\u201d.Greenacre near Eliot is a small place in Maine, which isthe largest of the six New England States and is in the farthestnortheast of the United States. Maine lies just across the southeastern boundary of New Hampshire, the only State whoseboundary it touches. Just to the south of New Hampshire liesMassachusetts, so that places in the latter State, such as Boston,Lynn, Salem, Annisquam, etc., which Swamiji had visited, andSwampscott where he was staying at the time, were not veryfar from Greenacre. It may be mentioned in this connectionthat the State of Maine is a great recreation centre, this industryearning an estimated $ 250,000,000 annually at the presentday. It draws crowds of visitors in the summer season when itstemperature ranges between 60 and 70 degrees. Greenacrewhich has this advantage of summer climate like the rest ofMaine and has besides other attractions, such as hills, a river,A GREAT TOWN HALL MEETING AT CALCUTTASWAMI VIVEKANANDA886and lofty pines, is also easily accessible. It is reached withinan hour or so by a steamer plying between Eliot and Portsmouthon a small river, named the Piscataqua, \u2014 Portsmouth whichis on the seacoast being easily reached by ship and rail fromany part of the U.S.A.Swamiji came to Greenacre on an invitation from MissSarah Farmer, whom he had met at New York, to attend a ratherunique religious conference that she had projected. She wasthe daughter of the famous Moses Gerrish Farmer who, someten years before Edison\u2019s invention of a marketable electricbulb (which, by the way, had made possible the wonderfulillumination of the World\u2019s Fair grounds at Chicago) had lighteda house in Cambridge with forty incandescent lamps in multiplecircuit. Swamiji had a high opinion of her personally. \u201cShe is anoble, noble lady,\u201d he wrote to Mary Hale about her, 22 June1895.37 A little earlier, on 25 April, he had written to Mrs. Bull,\u201cI will be only too glad to take Miss Farmer\u2019s advice, in spiteof ghosts and spooks. Behind the spooks, I see a heart ofimmense love, only covered with a thin film of laudableambition \u2014 even that is bound to vanish in a few years\u201d.38 Healso valued her project, as we learn from the fact that whenMrs. Bull offered him some money for his work in India, hewrote to her, 14 February 1895, suggesting that she should turnall her help to Miss Farmer\u2019s work at Greenacre that year. \u201cIndiacan wait\u201d he said, \u201cas she is waiting centuries and an immediatework at hand should always have preference\u201d.39Miss Farmer\u2019s project, the inspiration for which camefrom the Parliament of Religions \u2014 and for which she spentliberally out of her patrimony, \u201cso liberally as to cause the selfishand the cautious to wonder,\u201d \u2014 was a meeting of peoplebelonging to all sects at one place for living and meditating887together as a demonstration of the truth of the harmony of allreligions. In bringing about a conference at Greenacre nearEliot (Maine), where she had purchased some lands, she notonly put the idea of the Chicago Parliament into practice butwent further, for the assemblage \u201crepresented the overthrowof orthodox views and brought together the seething religiousthought of the age.\u201d It was a heterogeneous gathering, in whichwere to be found cranks of all sorts and some pious souls besidesthinkers like Dr. Lewis G. Janes, President of the Ethical CultureSociety of Brooklyn, who later conducted the School ofComparative Religions at Greenacre40 and, towering above all,Swamiji himself. Swamiji responded to Miss Farmer\u2019sinvitation because at this time he had no pressing lectureengagements and needed a rest of body and mind which thedays of living in the midst of nature of Greenacre promised togive him and also because he had a high regard for Miss Farmerand sympathized with her project.The character of the gathering and the life of theparticipants as also the work done by them there are described,with much sympathy and humour, by Swamiji in a letter hewrote to the Hale sisters from Greenacre Inn on 31 July 189441.On the open ground before the river, the large body of thedelegates, who include many old Chicago friends of Swamiji,like Mrs. Mills, Miss Stockham, and others, had their own livingtents. A little further and towards the hills, there was a muchlarger tent, inside which there were more than two hundredchairs used for lectures and meditations together. This wascalled the Eirenion, or Hall of Peace, and over it waved a big,white flag. Those among the delegates who either for age orinclination were unable to live the Bohemian life which thecampers lived, and at any rate had the necessary means, livedin the Greenacre Inn which was situated on a hill beyond theSWAMIJI AT GREENACRE CONFERENCESWAMI VIVEKANANDA888flat ground on which the tents stood. This Inn was surroundedby small cottages, in one of which, appropriately called\u201cNightingale\u2019s Rest\u201d, lived Miss Emma Thursby, the famoussinger, whose acquaintance Swamiji had recently made at NewYork, and who was later to become one of his followers.Over the hill, also, near the river there was a wood, inwhich, here and there, were several pines, which were namedby Mrs. Ole Bull (who, we thus know, participated in theConference) \u201cthe Lysekloster pines\u201d in honour of her home inNorway. Under one of these pines, to be known for long afterthis as the \u201cSwami\u2019s pine,\u201d Swamiji sat every morning \u201c a laHindu\u201d, as he said in the letter referred to above, giving histalks. Under this tree also, one night, they all and Swamiji wentto sleep \u201con the lap of mother earth,\u201d enjoying every bit of it.Speaking about this night, Swamiji confided to his \u201csisters\u201d,\u201cI cannot describe to you that night\u2019s glories \u2014 after a year ofbrutal life that I have led, to sleep on the ground, to meditateunder the tree in the forest!\u201d (Under this pine, it may bementioned here, later Swami Saradananda also spoke, and stilllater, Swami Abhedananda.) About his days and nights atGreenacre, Swamiji wrote again, in a letter to IsabelleMcKindley from Annisquam, 20 August 1894, as follows:\u201cPerhaps I did not tell you in my last how I slept and lived andpreached under the trees and for a few days at least found myselfonce more in the atmosphere of heaven\u201d.In the letter to the Sisters, 31 July 1894, referred to above.Swamiji spoke of the meeting at Greenacre as a session of theChristian Scientists. In a previous Chapter we have saidsomething about the Christian Scientists and what Swamijithought of them. In this letter he gave funny descriptions ofsome of the delegates, who were probably Christian Scientists,889perhaps also to tease his \u201csisters\u201d, as he sometimes did, as theybelonged to that faith. \u201cOne Mr. Colville, from Boston,\u201d wrotehe, \u201cis here; he speaks every day, it is said, under spirit control.The Editor (?) of the Universal Truth has settled herself downhere. She is conducting religious services and holding classesto heal all manner of diseases, and very soon I expect them tobe giving eyes to the blind, and the like. After all, it is a queergathering.. There is here Mr. Wood of Boston who is one of thegreat lights of your sect. But he objects to belong to the sect ofMrs. Whirlpool (for fun Swamiji used to call Mrs. Eddy Bakeras Mrs. Whirlpool). So he calls himself a mental healer of meta-physico-chemico, physico-religioso what not.. I teach themShivoham, Shivoham, and they all repeat it, innocent and pureas they are and brave beyond all bounds. And so I am happyand glorified\u201d.It is difficult to understand what intellectual or spiritualkinship Swamiji had with hard-shelled Christian Scientists likeMr. Wood, or Mr. Colville, or the lady who expected that byrepeating Shivoham all manner of diseases, including perhapseven blindness, could be cured. Yet he stayed at least two weekshere, fully participating in the life of the community. It washere after he had come to America that for the first time heregained something of the freedom of life that he had enjoyedas a roving monk in India. Greenacre was far indeed from beinga Himalayan retreat \u2014 one that he longed to spend his days inall his life \u2014 but here there were hills, a river, a forest with tallpines. We may be sure that he delivered lectures, or listened tothem (especially when his friend, Dr. Janes, was the speaker),or meditated along with others in the community but, otherwisehe was free from routine. He put on a bathing dress that CoraStockham had made for him and had \u201cas good a time in thewater as a duck\u201d. We have spoken about his night under theSWAMIJI AT GREENACRE CONFERENCESWAMI VIVEKANANDA890stars on the lap of mother earth that he described with muchfeeling in his letter to the Hale Sisters. We suppose he hadmany such nights, some in which he lay awake \u2014 meditating.He spoke of an outing at sea that he was going to have to anisland fifteen miles from the shore in the company of a lady ofDetroit \u2014 very cultured and with beautiful black eyes and longhair. All these were diversions that were beneficial so far ashis body and mind were concerned, but his visit to Greenacregave him something more.He did not think much of the religion of the ChristianScientists and, it goes without saying, had no faith in such thingsas table turnings, etc. He specially deplored that they were adry sort of people there: they did not understand \u201cMadhava\u201d,the Sweet One. (He thought that all over America it was thesame story.) But he recognized that they were \u201cvery good andpure people \u2014 a little erratic that is all\u201d, and he greatly admiredtheir courage. \u201cThey do not care much about social laws, andare quite free and happy,\u201d he wrote to Mary Hale. \u201cMrs. Millsis jumping all about the place; they are all in high spirits,\u201d hecontinued. \u201cThey have a lively time and sometimes all of themwore what you call your scientific dress,\u201d he told Mary Hale.What, above all, he admired about them was the spirit of fightagainst odds that they (the camp dwellers) displayed when acyclone hit the colony threatening it with complete destruction.He gave a fine description of the episode to Mary Hale.\u201cYesterday there was a tremendous cyclone which gave a good`treatment\u2019 to the tents. The big tent under which they had thelectures had developed so much spirituality, under the`treatment\u2019, that it entirely disappeared from mortal gaze andabout two hundred chairs were dancing about the ground underspiritual ecstasy\u201d. He highly praised their courage when thestorm was blowing over their heads threatening their camp891with destruction. Wrote he, \u201cThe Dudes and Dudines are inthe Hotel, but ironbound nerves and souls of triple steel are inthe camp. If you had seen them yesterday, when the rain wasfalling in torrents and the cyclone was overturning everything,hanging by their tent strings to keep them from being blowndown, and standing on the majesty of their souls \u2014 these braveones \u2014 it would have done your hearts good. I will go a hundredmiles to see the like of them. Lord bless them!\u201dStrength Swamiji always admired and it is no wonderthat he gave these stouthearted men and women at Greenacrehis company for two weeks, or that every morning he taughtthem Sivoham, Sivoham, which they repeated. Unfortunately,there is no record of what he said to them in his discourses butone may believe that here he spoke more on the philosophy ofthe Hindus than on their manners and customs, as he had donein many of his public lectures so far. Mrs. Marie Louise Burkeis of opinion that it was in his Greenacre classes that \u201che taughtfor the first time in America the philosophy of Advaita Vedantato a group of eager listeners\u201d.42 In any case, it was here that, ala Hindu, i.e., as a spiritual teacher does in India, he sat beforea group of listeners who, like disciples in India, were permeatedby the power that emanated from him, and that he held classesrather than delivered orations. Without doubt, Sivoham was aword which Christian Scientists were familiar with, it beingwith them a magic, faith healing mantra. But Swamiji gavethem its real and deeper meaning \u2014 the realization of theidentity of the human self with the Absolute. He recited tothem daily the verses of the Nirvanashatka or Atmashatka ofSankaracharya, (Om manobuddhyahamkarachittani naham. ..Chidanandarupah sivo\u2019ham.., etc. I am neither the mind, northe intellect, nor the ego, nor the mind stuff.. I am ExistenceAbsolute, Knowledge Absolute, Bliss Absolute \u2014 I am He, ISWAMIJI AT GREENACRE CONFERENCESWAMI VIVEKANANDA892am He). On one occasion, he told his listeners, \u201cYou and I andeverything in the universe are that Absolute, not parts but thewhole. You are the whole of the Absolute\u201d. This, indeed, is thequintessence of Vedantic thought as the Nirvanashatka is itsmost powerful poetic expression.It is difficult to form an estimate of the success Swamijihad in this his first endeavour to preach the truth of Vedanta toa group of earnest minded people in the manner this was donein India. It is likely that a few caught the flame and certainlysome like Mrs. Ole Bull, Dr. Lewis G. Janes and a few others,became genuinely imbued with the Vedantic spirit. Theyremained true to the cause throughout their lives and helpedSwamiji and, after him, his followers in spreading Vedanta inAmerica. But the Conference was too heterogeneous a body\u2014 with each individual having a fad of his or her own thoughopen-minded and tolerant of others\u2019 views \u2014 to be able in thecourse of a few weeks of community living to produce definiteresults. Leaving out exceptional personalities, such as the oneswe have mentioned above, few could be found in thecommunity whose minds had opened out to the lofty teachingsof Vedanta though many, parrot like, repeated Sivo\u2019ham,Sivo\u2019ham as Swamiji recited the verses of the Nirvanashatka.Swamiji\u2019s regard for Miss Farmer remainedundiminished and his interest in her Conferences did not lessenbut it is significant that he did not attend another meeting ofthe Conference. He and Miss Farmer agreed with each otheron many points but it was not possible for him to identifyhimself with her cause. In a letter to Mrs. Bull, written on 25April 1895 at a time, be it noted, when he was actuallyexperimenting on a new method, viz., holding classes onVedanta in New York, he expressed himself frankly and893unambiguously on the Greenacre Conference. Wrote he, \u201cIcannot go to Greenacre now; I have arranged to go to ThousandIsland Park, wherever that may be. There is a cottage belongingto Miss Dutcher, one of my students, and a few of us will bethere in rest and peace and seclusion. I want to manufacture afew `yogis\u2019 out of the materials of the classes and a busy farmlike Greenacre is the last place for that, while the other is quiteout of the way, and none of the curiosity seekers will dare gothere\u201d.43 A few months later, on 22 June 1895, he wrote toMary Hale, gleefully advising her to attend the Conferencethere. He said, \u201cHow are you going on with your ChristianScience lessons? I hope you will go to Greenacre, there youwill find quite a lot of them and also the spiritualists, tableturnings, palmists, astrologers, etc. You will get all the `cures\u2019and all the `isms\u2019 presided over by Miss Farmer\u201d.44 Obviously,Swamiji had found that the Greenacre community did notprovide the stuff and the milieu that were needed for the carryingout of his plan. In the Greenacre conference, however, Swamiji saw thepractical application of his (and Vedantic) teaching that man isnot a sinner, that his progress is not from evil or ignorance togood or truth but from knowledge to higher knowledge andthat \u201cthe kingdom of heaven is already in existence if we willhave it, that perfection is already in man if he will see it\u201d. In aletter to Miss Farmer dated 28 December 1896 45, Swamijicomplimented her on opening herself fully to this thoughtwhich, he said, was struggling for expression, as also on takingher stand on the highest teaching of this thought, namely, thatthe kingdom of heaven already exists. He wrote, \u201cOur Gitateaches that he who serves the servants of the Lord is the highestworshipper. You are a servant of the Lord, and as a disciple ofKrishna I will always consider it a privilege and worship toSWAMIJI AT GREENACRE CONFERENCESWAMI VIVEKANANDA894render you any service in the carrying out of your inspiredmission wherever I be\u201d. To sum up, it may be said that, thoughhe did not entirely approve of the Greenacre Conference, it didmean something to him. If it cannot be said that it was atGreenacre that for the first time he formulated a new methodof work, his participation in it was \u201ca foreshadowing of whatwas to come \u2014 the beginnings of a new method of work\u201d.IVBetween 12 August 1894, when Swamiji left Greenacre, and27 January 1895, when he settled down at New York, therewere four and a half months, during which, tired in body,disgusted with the lecturing business, and convinced of theneed for a change of method as he was, he continued, almostunceasingly, to travel and lecture. If he were asked how thiswas so, he would have probably answered that he was in God\u2019shands, or that he was working out his karma. A number oftimes during these months we find him expressing the hope, oreven deciding that he should change to something else, butsomehow or other nothing happened. He wrote on 20 August1894 to Isabelle McKindley, \u201cI have given up all moneymakingschemes and will be quite satisfied with a bite and a shed andwork on\u201d.46 A work that he was having in his mind for a prettylong time was to write a book. The first indication of this isfound in a letter to Alasinga written as early as 11 July 1894,though there he said that he intended to do so because therewas little scope for lecturing at that time of the year47. That theidea stuck in his brain is more firmly indicated in his next letterto him, written on 31 August (after he had read the report ofthe Madras meeting in the Boston Evening Transcript), in whichhe said, \u201cI am now going to write my mems in a book, and next895winter will go about this country organizing societies here\u201d.On 13 September he wrote to Mary Hale, \u201cToday this vagabondlama was seized with a desire of going right along scribblingand so I walked down and entering a store bought all sorts ofwriting material and a beautiful portfolio which shuts with aclasp and has even a little wooden inkstand. So far it promiseswell. Hope it will continue\u201d.48 On 19 September he wrote toMrs. Bull that what he wanted was to get a place where hecould sit down and write down his thoughts. \u201cI have had enoughof speaking; now I want to write,\u201d said he, adding that heintended to go to Mrs. Guernsey\u2019s place in New York and therewrite his book.49At this time, however, as we learn from this very letter,Swamiji was lecturing in several places in Boston and, naturally,he had not the leisure to write a book. Though he could not dothat, he did write at this time his long and famous Reply to theMadras Address,50 which was a marvel of scholarship, as wellas an illuminating exposition of Hindu religion and culture,and an eloquent call to the nation to rise from its slumber. In afamous passage in this Reply, he posed the question, \u201cShallIndia die?\u201d and gave the answer to it as follows, \u201cSuch a thingcan never be\u201d. His argument was as emphatic as it was eloquent.\u201cThen from the world all spirituality will be extinct, all moralperfection will be extinct, and in its place will reign the dualityof lust and luxury as the male and female deities, with moneyas its priest, force, fraud and competition its ceremonies, andthe human soul its sacrifice\u201d. The concluding words of theReply were, \u201cOne vision I see clear as life before me, that theancient Mother has awakened once more, sitting on Her throne\u2014 rejuvenate \u2014 more glorious than ever. Proclaim Her to allthe world with the voice of peace and benediction\u201d. His lettersto India during this period contained similar insistent calls andSWAMIJI AT GREENACRE CONFERENCESWAMI VIVEKANANDA896outlines for work, though they conveyed to his people also thesad information that personally he was broken down in healthand badly needed some rest. He wrote to Alasinga on 21September 1894, \u201cI have had enough of this country, andspecially as too much work is making me nervous. . . So youwill see I will soon return (to India)\u201d.51 In a letter to SwamiRamakrishnananda, written four days later, he said the samething about his health and his intention to return to India soon,but gave the call as follows, \u201cHurl yourselves on the worldlike an avalanche \u2014 let the world crack in twain under yourweight\u201d.52Swamiji\u2019s plan to write a book did not materialize andin his letter to Alasinga of 21 September, referred to above, hesaid that he had not been able to write a line. Perhaps on thatvery day he sat down with renewed determination and penneda few lines, because in his letter to Swami Ramakrishnanandawritten four days later he said, \u201cI am writing a book. As soonas it is finished, I run for home\u201d. Meanwhile, Mrs. Bull, in herreply to his letter dated 19 September, referred to above, hadinvited him to come to her home in Cambridge and offered toplace at his disposal the room in it, paneled in Indian teakwoodthat had witnessed many meetings in which intellectuals,  Prof.William James among them, had held many discussions.Swamiji had evidently already heard about this room from Mrs.Bull herself while they were together at Greenacre, for we findhim writing about it and about Mrs. Bull in a letter fromAnnisquam to Isabelle McKindley on 20 August 1894.53Already also he had begun to cherish feelings of confidence inand respect for Mrs. Bull, as we find him addressing her, in hisletter to her dated 19 September, referred to above, as \u201cDearMother Sara\u201d. On 26 September, he warmly accepted Mrs. OleBull\u2019s invitation, adding that much less space than what she897had kindly offered to put at his disposal would suffice for him.Swamiji duly arrived at Cambridge on 2 October 1894 andspent about nine or ten days in peace and rest with Mrs. Bull,occasionally perhaps also giving a few informal talks to herintellectual friends, in which Prof. William James may haveparticipated. It was perhaps at this time that he demonstratedto Prof. James the mystery of divine communion by plungingin his presence in Samadhi. The ostensible purpose of his visit\u2014 writing a book \u2014 however, remained unfulfilled.During these months, Swamiji also planned to moveabout and organize a few societies in America, as he toldAlasinga in a letter to him on 11 July 1894, referred to by usabove. We know little about the nature and purpose of theproposed societies but Mrs. Burke who, as we know, is ofopinion that it was not till the end of this year that Swamijiseriously thought of teaching Vedanta, thinks that their purposewas \u201cno doubt more financial than philosophical andreligious\u201d.54 Since, however, the period of Swamiji\u2019s life inAmerica with which we are at present dealing can broadly beregarded as one of transition, one may also think that thesesocieties may have been among the pointers to the next phaseof his activities. The discussion, however, is merely an academicone since, it seems, Swamiji could give little shape to his idea.It is probable that, in November, Swamiji founded one societyof the type that he had planned, in New York, and the wrote toAlasinga on 30 November, about it. We do not, however, hearanything further about it for at least about a year, or about hishaving founded any other society at this time.It seems that at this time Swamiji had yet another plan,viz., to found an international university in America but,curiously, our only source of information concerning it, meagreSUNDRY PLANSSWAMI VIVEKANANDA898as it is, is American, Swamiji himself being never found tohave referred to it in his speeches and letters of this period.References to the subject are found in American magazinesreporting Swamiji\u2019s visit to Baltimore at the invitation of theVrooman brothers (see below), who may have \u201clured him,\u201d55there with promises of their help and cooperation in carryingout the project. The Baltimore American spoke about it asfollows, \u201cHe (Swamiji) favours the establishment in thiscountry of an international university, where all the religionsof the world can be taught, for he thinks there is no more needof American missionaries going to India than there is of Indianmissionaries coming to America\u201d. According to the SundayHerald, Rev. Hiran Vrooman spoke to one of its reporters aboutthe scheme thus, \u201cThis University is one of Mr. Vivekananda\u2019spet ideas, and has the full sympathy of myself and my brothers,and also a number of gentlemen of wealth and position,including several religions. Among its promoters are membersof the Catholic and Hebrew religions. The idea of the universityis education in general religion\u201d.56The scheme did not materialize, the difficulties in theway being, as we can clearly see, too many. It was surely to beopposed by Swamiji\u2019s old friends, the Christian missionaries,if one of the objects was to stop the flow of these emissaries ofChrist to heathen lands. It is interesting to read that somepromoters were Catholics, but one feels sure that if they lookedkindly at the proposed international university, they did so withmental reservations, or in the hope that it might serve theirpurposes. It goes without saying that Roman Catholicism and\u201cgeneral religion\u201d hardly go together, and the outcome of theChicago Parliament had been anything but satisfying to RomanCatholics, or for that matter, to other Christian sects who hadparticipated in it. Under the circumstances, the prospects for899\u201cgeneral religion\u201d lay rather in the activities of such freethinkersas had recently gathered at Greenacre and continued to do sothere year after year. Swamiji\u2019s ideas of an internationalinstitution for propagating general religion found a partialfulfillment in the Monsalvat School of Comparative Religionsthat his friend, Dr. Lewis G. Janes, conducted at Greenacre formany years.Swami Vivekananda\u2019s mind, from even his boyhood,leaned, as we have seen, to quiet contemplation and, as hegrew older, the desire for intensive sadhana, even samadhi ofthe highest state, became stronger and stronger. Even inAmerica, where his days were spent in constant travel, lecturing,and similar activities, his mind, as we have said in an earlierChapter, occasionally verged on nirvikalpa samadhi, while itlost itself frequently in samadhi and sometimes, when thishappened in his yogic classes at New York, his pupils found itdifficult to bring him to. \u201cApart altogether from meditation\u201d,as Sister Nivedita has told us, \u201che was constantly losing himselfin thought. In the midst of the clatter and fun of society, onewould notice the eyes grow still, and the breath come at longerand longer intervals; the pause; and then the gradual return\u201d.57After a year of stay in America, he may have succeeded inrestraining his mind from losing itself in contemplation as itoften did during his early days at Chicago. Even while he wasin a tram, as Sister Nivedita tells us, he then used often toforget to get down at his destination and had to pay the fare forthe whole length of the journey perhaps more than once in asingle journey.58 He had, since then, apparently adjusted himselfto his surroundings \u2014 eating the food that was offered him byhis hosts, or that he got in hotels where he stayed, dressinghimself (except on a few occasions when he put on his nativemonkish costume), so as to avoid the startled gaze of the crowd,SUNDRY PLANSSWAMI VIVEKANANDA900in near Western style and even, it is said, observing withmeticulous care the social etiquette of the West. But this wasstill on the surface and, to quote Sister Nivedita again, \u201cbeneath,the will glowed with all its old fervour, the mind held itselfever on the brink of the universal\u201d.59At this time, as we learn from letters he wrote to hisfriends and disciples, his mind was revolting against the lifethat he was leading, and his longing for a cave in the Himalayasin which quietly to meditate was becoming more intense everyday. As early as May, 1894, he had written to Prof. Wright,\u201cThe way to God is the opposite to that of the world. . . Myplace is in the Himalayas. . .\u201d60 His letters to his gurubhais anddisciples were full of exhortation for work and service andoutlines of action, but he warned them not to count on him. On28 May 1894, he wrote to Alasinga, \u201cIt is better to leaveeverything in the hands of Him who is at my back directingme. Try to work without me, as if I never existed\u201d.61 His letterto Mary and Harriet Hale, dated 26 June 1894, referred to onceabove, reflected the true state of his mind \u2014 resignation to thewill of God. It is probable that the brief taste that he had atGreenacre of meditating in solitude, in sight of the hills, by theside of a river, and under the canopy of heavens threw his mindback to the days of his wanderings in the Himalayas. FromAnnisquam on 27 September 1894 he wrote to Alasinga, \u201cThisnonsense of public life and newspaper blazoning has disgustedme thoroughly. I long to go back to the Himalayan quiet\u201d.62This was not to be \u2014 for some more time yet. \u201cI wascaught in the trap,\u201d he wrote to Mary Hale on 1 November1894, \u201cand now no more of a reserved life\u201d.63 Despite hisaversion for \u201cthat nasty lecturing business\u201d (as he had expressedhimself on the subject in his letter to Isabelle McKindley on 2901May 1894)64 and bodily fatigue, he went on lecturing, wheneveran opportunity presented itself, for some time more. Mrs. Burkebelieves that this was so because \u201che was destined, beforesettling down to one place, to spread his influence throughoutAmerica, to scatter his blessings and the potent seeds ofspirituality over wide areas, to meet thousands upon thousandsof people and to stir not only their minds but the deep recessesof their souls \u2014 those depths which none but a prophet of hisnature could reach and awaken\u201d.65 One may also think that hewas in God\u2019s hands, and, as Sri Ramakrishna had told him,was destined to be a teacher of humanity (his very bones wouldcompel him to undertake the role, the saint had said), that, ashe himself knew, he was to be a wanderer over the earth withoutknowing when or where the noose would get tied to his feet.\u201cIt seemed almost as it were by some antagonistic power,\u201dwrote Sister Nivedita, that he was `bowled along from place toplace, being broken the while\u2019 to use his own graphic phrase\u201d.66Above all, as he said many times, while others might seek theirown salvation, it was for him to seek the welfare of humanity,sacrificing not one but a hundred lives of his on earth for thepurpose and knowing that he was thereby serving God.That these ideas were uppermost in his mind during thesedays - ideas which are characteristically Swami Vivekananda\u2019s\u2014 is indicated in a soul stirring letter that he wrote to Alasingaon 27 October 1894, \u201cI do not believe in a God, or religion,\u201dhe declared, \u201cwhich cannot wipe the widow\u2019s tears, or bring apiece of bread to the orphan\u2019s mouth. However sublime be thetheories, however well spun be the philosophy \u2014 I do not callit religion so long as it is confined to books and dogmas. Theeye is in the forehead, and not in the back, Move onward andcarry into practice that which you are very proud to call yourreligion, and God bless you.. Look not at me, look to yourselves.REPLY TO THE MADRAS ADDRESSSWAMI VIVEKANANDA902I am happy to have been the occasion of an enthusiasm. Takeadvantage of it, float along with it, and everything will comeright. Love never fails, my son; today or tomorrow or agesafter, truth will conquer. Love shall win the victory. Do youlove your fellowmen? Where should you go to seek for God \u2014are not all the poor, the miserable, the weak, gods? Why notworship them first?\u201d67He preached to his disciples what he practiced himself.And, with obvious reference to the calls he was often receivingfrom well-meaning friends that he should return to India andwork for his own countrymen, he said as follows, \u201cI believe inhelping the miserable, I believe in going even to hell to saveothers. Talk of Westerners?. . .No man, no nation, my son, canhate others and live. India\u2019s doom was sealed the very day theyinvented the word MLECHCHA and stopped communion withothers. Take care how you foster that idea. It is good to talkglibly about the Vedanta, but how hard to carry out even itsleast precepts\u201d.68 He expressed himself still more clearly onthis point in a letter to his English disciple, Mr. E. T. Sturdy, on9 August 1895, as follows: \u201cDoubtless I love India. But everyday my sight grows clearer. What is India, or England, orAmerica to me? We are the servants of that God who by theignorant is called MAN. He who pours water at the root, doeshe not water the whole tree?\u201d69 So no nation could make anexclusive claim upon him, he was to serve God \u2014 his God \u2014in accordance with his own lights, it was not for him to choosehow he was to do so and, broadly, it was to be for the good ofthe world if also for the salvation of his soul (atmanahmokshartham jagaddhitaya cha.) East and West did not matter,he was not to function as a divine prophet to America alone, orto India alone and, one may think, he was to carry out hismission on the wide earth, as Sri Ramakrishna had prophesied.903VOn 26 July 1894 Swami Vivekananda had written fromSwampscott to the Hale Sisters that on his way back fromGreenacre he would go to Annisquam to see Mrs. Bagley for afew days.70 Two weeks later, on 11 August 1894, he wrote againto them from Greenacre that on the following day (Sunday) hewas going to Plymouth at the invitation of Col. ThomasWentworth Higginson to deliver a lecture at his \u201cSympathy ofReligions\u201d. Col. Higginson had probably attended theGreenacre Conference and extended the invitation to Swamijithere, after the two, who had first made their acquaintance witheach other at the Chicago Parliament, had had intimateconversations during their stay there and found that they agreedon many essential points. If this surmise is correct, Col.Higginson, aged 71, must also have caught the eye of the youngmonk, as one among the \u201cironbound nerves and souls of triplesteel\u201d who hung by their tent strings, fighting against thecyclone that was blowing over their heads, as described bySwamiji in his letter to Mary and Harriet Hale, referred toabove. In his youth, Higginson, an ardent abolitionist andonetime Unitarian Church pastor, had led the first regiment ofNegro soldiers in the Civil war. After retiring from the army,he had become known as a writer and a liberal reformer, whostill clung to Transcendentalist ideas, when the vogue hadpassed. He was a familiar figure at Cambridge with his old butvigorous body seated bolt upright on a bicycle that sped dailythrough the streets at five miles an hour. However, what inducedSwamiji to postpone his visit to Mrs. Bagley by a few days andcome to Plymouth was not Higginson\u2019s extraordinary physicalvigour in his old age, which he surely admired, but hislatitudinarianism, which had distinguished him among theChristian delegates at Chicago and of which he may have comeSWAMIJI AT BALTIMORESWAMI VIVEKANANDA904to have a more exact idea during their days together atGreenacre. Higginson did not consider other faiths as just \u201cdimtwilights\u201d heralding the glorious dawn of Christianity, as \u201ctheliberal minded\u201d among the Christians (like Dr. Barrows) did.In a paper that he had read at the Parliament he had expressedthe view that each religion alone was partial, and that it tookall of them together to represent the \u201cReligion of Ages, NaturalReligion\u201d. This accorded with Swamiji\u2019s view of \u201cacceptance\u201d,not merely toleration, of all religions, while the very name ofHigginson\u2019s association (as it was of the paper that he had readat the Parliament), viz, \u201cThe Sympathy of Religions\u201d, suggestedstill closer similarity to them. (Swamiji had said at Detroit,\u201cWhy take a single instrument from the great religious orchestraof the earth? Let the great symphony go on\u201d.)Unfortunately, nothing is known about what Swamiji saidin his lecture at Plymouth on 12 August 1894 but it must havestrengthened the feeling of kinship between the two men, sincewe know that later Higginson again invited Swamiji to speakbefore the Free Religious Association, of which he was thePresident and which had been founded by Emerson. Afterleaving Plymouth, Swamiji again paid a visit to the Guernseysat Fishkill Landing, where he stayed for a few days. He thentravelled to Mrs. Bagley\u2019s summer home at Annisquam, inresponse to her invitation, about which we have already spoken.This was his second visit to the place, and was a pleasing tohim for a number of reasons. He was very happy to live oncemore with the Bagleys  who, one and all, loved him, and if hehad ever doubted their attitude to him, their affectionatereception and the days spent together, endeared them to himand him to them all the more. It was while he was with theBagleys at Annisquam that he read an editorial of the BostonEvening Transcript based on a circular received by the paper905from the organizers of the Madras meeting. As we have saidabove, he had personally learned about the meeting long agofrom a letter written to him by Alasinga that had reached himabout the beginning of the second week of July. Due probablyto some bungling at Madras, as we have said above, theproceedings of the meeting did not reach America so long,but, now that the American papers received and published them,the fact was highly gratifying to him because they had the effectof fully vindicating him in the eyes of the American public(see Section II above.)It was now a year since he, a stranger from a far-off land,unknown to fame, had come and stayed as a guest at Prof.Wright\u2019s cottage at this small village of Annisquam and stirredthe minds of the simple folk of the place no less by his forthrighttalks with them than by his awe-inspiring dress and majesticappearance. He had come back to them \u2014 the same lovableyoung monk \u2014 now in his glory as a prophet acknowledgedby thousands all over the land as having a message to deliverto them all. Happy they were to hear him as he expounded tothem the religion of his ancient land and, if they could notfollow the philosophy on which it was based, they were happyto learn how liberal and tolerant it was in its practicalapplications. They were gratified to learn also, when he toldthem in the course of the lecture he delivered to them in theMechanic Hall (Tuesday, 4 September), that the lecture that hehad delivered at the very place a year earlier had been the firstpublic discourse that he ever gave in English, or in his nativelanguage. He thanked them heartily for their kindness that hadinduced him to attempt to do so. His friend, Prof. Wright, whowas away when Swamiji arrived at Annisquam, had come tothat place to meet him, and introduced him to his audiencewith a few words befitting the occasion.SWAMIJI AT BALTIMORESWAMI VIVEKANANDA906In an unpublished letter written from Annisquam to hisfriend. Manmatha Nath Bhattacharya, at Madras, to whichreferences have been made in a few early Chapters of this work,Swamiji gave a delightful account of the crowds of young menand women who were to be met with in the sunny beach ofAnnisquam. (The letter is partly in Bengali and partly inEnglish. In the early part Swamiji\u2019s mood is joyous, but in theconcluding portion which is in English it is serious and there isan exhortation, much as we find in some of his letters of thisperiod to Alasinga and Swami Ramakrishnananda, for workand service in the spirit of dedication to the Motherland. Thereis nowhere in the letter an indication that he was having, or,for that matter, ever had an anxious time, and there is noreference to the Boston Evening Transcript editorial, which hemust have read only a few days back.) Apart from having ahappy time with the Bagleys and the pleasure of meeting oldfriends like Prof. Wright and Dr. Bradley of Evanston, Swamijihad many delightful boat rides and at least one drenching,which, however, did not spoil his \u201cbeautiful black suit\u201d which,as he wrote to Mary Hale, she liked much, and he happened tobe putting on at that time, and had been permeated with his\u201cdeep meditations on the Absolute\u201d.71 Swamiji came toAnnisquam around 16 August, and must have left a few daysafter 5 September, as he wrote in his letter to Manmatha NathBhattacharya, which bears that date.Refreshed in body and mind, Swamiji began the secondyear of his life in America with lectures at Boston, where hespent the whole of September. These lectures, to which he refersin a letter to Mrs. Bull, 19 September 1894, were, however,not reported in the papers, being perhaps mostly deliveredbefore private or semiprivate gatherings.72 As we have seenabove, in this letter Swamiji had informed Mrs. Bull about his907intention to write a book and to go to Mrs. Guernsey\u2019s home atNew York and sit down there to write. As we have seen also,Mrs. Bull in reply had invited him to come to her home atCambridge for the purpose. Swamiji had accepted theinvitation, but before he arrived at Cambridge on 2 October,paid a visit to Melrose, a town a few miles to the north ofBoston, and delivered two lectures there. After staying for aboutnine or ten days again at New York, Swamiji proceeded toBaltimore in Maryland at the invitation of the Vroomanbrothers, Hiram, Carl, and Walter, who had arranged somemeetings in that city for propagating what they called \u201cDynamicReligion\u201d. These three brothers were adventurous young men,who had probably managed to meet Swamiji at Boston andimposed on him with talks of dynamic religion and plans foran international university, thereby inducing him to come toBaltimore and speak at the meetings arranged for by them. Atthe first of these meetings, which was held at the LycaeumTheatre on 14 October 1894, the three brothers did most of thetalking, Swamiji who was the last to speak mostly endorsingwhat they had said on \u201cdynamic religion\u201d. At the secondmeeting, which was held at the same place on 21 October,Swamiji was the main speaker.\u201cDynamic religion,\u201d said Rev. Walter Vrooman, \u201cmeansreligion in motion, and is opposed to that religion at rest whichis locked up in the hundreds of huge stone buildings scatteredthroughout our cities, during the whole week, with the exceptionof a couple of hours, during which time the people are allowedto go in and nibble at it as though it had a medicinal effect ineasing the pains caused by conscience\u201d. All three brotherswaxed eloquent in their expositions of the subject andoccasionally referred also to the plan of an internationaluniversity, but their real interest lay elsewhere, viz., denouncingSWAMIJI AT PLYMOUTHSWAMI VIVEKANANDA908the political immorality which was rampant in the city. At boththe meetings Swamiji sat \u201cwith imperturbable stolidity\u201dlistening to the speeches of the brothers and speaking only atthe end with his usual force and feeling and receiving theheartiest applauses from the listeners. With much of what theVrooman brothers spoke, as for example the difference that isfound between the preaching and the practice of religion,Swamiji was in hearty agreement and he expressed himself so,adding to them, however, something of his own experience asarguments in their support. He referred, for example, to themissionary work in India, and remarked that it would be betterto send fewer men and more money. \u201cIndia has bushels full ofdoctrines and to spare. What is wanted is the means to carrythem out,\u201d said he. \u201cPrayer may be done in different ways.Prayer with the hands is yet higher than prayer with the lipsand is more saving\u201d, he added. In his lecture at the secondmeeting, he elaborated his ideas by referring to Buddha andhis religion. He said, \u201cBuddha found in India too much talkingabout God and His essence and too little work. He alwaysinsisted upon this fundamental truth, that we are to be pureand holy, and that we are to help others to be holy also. Adozen Buddhas in India at the present time would do good,and one Buddha in this country would also be beneficial\u201d.It seems that the Vrooman brothers had brought overSwamiji to Baltimore expecting that the support which he wassure to give to their ideas of dynamic religion and so on wouldadvance their own interests. From what we know about theirearly life \u2014two of them (Hiram and another) had at timespeddled soap, then invested their earnings in the peanut businessin their early teens \u2014 it appears that they were ambitiouscareerists, though  talking in highfalutin language about ideals.At the time they met Swamiji, the two elder brothers were909clergymen and the youngest was preparing himself to be acleric. Their youth (the oldest among them was younger thanSwamiji and the youngest in his twenties), their fervour andtheir bright ideas captivated Swamiji, who may have seenthrough their appearances, but still admired their energy andresourcefulness. He did not seem, however, to have expectedthat, self-centered as he must have noticed they were, theywould show so much callousness about the personal comfortsof their guest as they did at his arrival at Baltimore. It wasindeed a very strange hospitality that they extended to himwhen, instead of escorting him on his arrival at the city to theirown house, Walter took Swamiji from one third-rate hotel toanother, only to be turned away on the ground of colour. Heshould have known that in his own Maryland as in other SouthAtlantic States race and colour prejudices were strong \u2014 hehimself may have for the same reason changed his mind aboutkeeping Swamiji at his own house as a guest \u2014and that thehotel managers could easily be expected to behave as they did.\u201cAs late as 1912\u201d, Martha Browne Fincke recalled, whilecommending the courage of the lady manager of their hostel inaccepting Swamiji as a guest during his visit to Northampton,\u201cthe great poet Tagore with his companion wandered throughthe streets of New York looking in vain for shelter!\u201d73 However,after Swamiji was thus, for the fourth time, refused admission,the Rev. Walter Vrooman took him to Hotel Rennert, the mostfashionable hotel in the city, and there, after procuring a roomfor him, left him to his own devices.Swamiji, who was quite aware of the ugliness of raceprejudice in America \u2014 having had by the time manydisagreeable personal experiences \u2014 was quite unperturbedat the treatment he received from hotel managers at Baltimore.In a letter to Mrs. Bull dated 27 October 189474 he laid theSWAMIJI AT BALTIMORESWAMI VIVEKANANDA910blame for it at the door of the Vrooman brothers rather than thehotel managers. He said, \u201cWhy should they take me to a lowhotel?\u201d Asking her not to be sorry over his discomfiture, heinformed her that after the expected had happened, \u201cAmericanwomen, as everywhere,\u201d came to his rescue, and that he had \u201cavery good time\u201d. It is probable that even Rennert had acceptedhim only as a temporary guest on the condition that he shouldshift as early as possible elsewhere and that hence arose theoccasion for the good ladies of Baltimore to offer him theirhospitality. (Mrs. Patterson, the wife of the American ConsulGeneral in Calcutta in 1898, who accompanied SwamiVivekananda to Kashmir, is believed to have been one of thethese ladies). Whatever that was, Swamiji quicklyaccommodated himself to the situation in which he foundhimself and when, in the afternoon of the same day, a reporterof the Baltimore American interviewed him in the hotel,impressed him with his charming conversation and scholarship.He told him that India had too much religion and America toolittle of it and that his country could profit if it sent over itssurplus religion to America, having in return some of America\u2019sadvancement and civilization. So also, when a reporter of theSunday Herald met him on the next day, as he was seated withmajestic calm in the main lobby of the hotel, he conversedpleasantly with him, displaying the greatest familiarity withthe institutions of the country, religious, political and social(stress added). Both reporters gave brilliant pen pictures ofSwamiji, which we refrain from quoting here because theyhighlight some features of his personal appearance in the sameappreciative language as was used by many previous reporterswhom we have already quoted from in the previous pages.The Vrooman brothers evidently expected Swamiji toplay second fiddle to them and, in the two meetings organized911by them, utilized the better part of the time in expounding theirbrilliant ideas with much oratorical flourish. But though at thefirst meeting, Swamiji could speak only briefly \u201cafter theoratory that had preceded him\u201d, in the second meeting he wasthe main speaker. On this occasion he spoke on Buddha,presumably because the preceding speaker, the Rev. HiramVrooman, had in his speech dwelt largely on the subject ofconflict \u2014 representing the fight going on in Baltimore betweenthose who were against political immorality and those whowere practicing it as the Biblical fight between David andGoliath. That he chose to speak on Buddha and Buddhism mayalso have had something to do with the fact that the Vroomanbrothers, who professed to have a great respect for him, wereunder the impression that he was a Buddhist and had been sentby the ecclesiastics of that religion to represent them at theParliament of Religions. We know that even at the ParliamentSwamiji was considered by many to be a Buddhist, if onlybecause he professed great veneration for Buddha and, as thereso also at Baltimore, he did not contradict the idea. However,in his speech at the second meeting, Swamiji said about Buddhaas follows, \u201cHe believed in the good of all. His religion, asformulated by him, consisted of the discovery of three things:First, `There is an evil\u2019; second, `What is the cause of this evil?\u2019This he ascribed to the desires of men to be superior to others,an evil that could be cured by unselfishness. Third, `This evilis curable by becoming unselfish\u2019. Force, he concluded, couldnot cure it; dirt cannot wash dirt; hate cannot cure hate\u2019.\u201d Wedo not know what effect these words had on the minds of theVrooman brothers, preoccupied as they were with their fightagainst civic immorality at Baltimore but at the conclusion ofSwamiji\u2019s speech, there was \u201ca hearty burst of applause\u201d fromthe audience. One of the chief local magazines, the BaltimoreAmerican, it is interesting to learn, confined its report of theSWAMIJI AT BALTIMORESWAMI VIVEKANANDA912meeting to an account of Swamiji\u2019s speech, giving no space tothose of the Vroomans. Swamiji seems to have been impressedwith the appreciation by the public of Baltimore of his speeches,and revisited the city, lecturing there on 2 and 5 November.In some of the preceding Chapters we have occasionallyreferred to Swamiji\u2019s experiences of ill-treatment at the handsof racial fanatics and his sympathy for the Negroes who, evenafter their emancipation, continued (and still continue) toreceive unfair treatment at the hands of the Whites, speciallyin the Southern States. In connection with what we have saidabout the treatment he received at Baltimore, it may not beirrelevant to give here some stories of his ill-treatment whichSwamiji has narrated in his Memoirs of European Travel.75They may relate to Baltimore, or to Philadelphia, or to someother south or middle Atlantic State, or, for that matter, to anyother place anywhere in America, for racial prejudices existedeverywhere in the country, and he received some roughtreatment even in Chicago. Swamiji narrates his experienceswith pleasant humour, which may make the stories readable toall save perhaps the worst racial fanatics. \u201cI was sorely troubledby an overgrown beard,\u201d says Swamiji in the book underreference, \u201cbut no sooner had I peeped into a haircutting saloonthan somebody called out, `This is no place for such shabbylooking people as you\u2019. (He was dressed in gerua and turban\u2026)I met the same kind of treatment in one or two saloons, afterwhich I began the practice of shaving with my own hands.Once I was burning with hunger, and went into a restaurantand asked for a particular thing, whereupon the man said, `Wedo not stock it.\u2019 `Why, it is there.\u2019 `Well, my good man, in plainlanguage, it means there is no place for you to sit and take yourmeal\u2019. `And why?\u2019 `Because nobody will eat at the same tablewith you, for he will be outcasted\u2019. Then America began to913look agreeable to me, somewhat like my own caste riddencountry.\u201dVISwami Vivekananda left Baltimore and arrived at Washingtonon 22 or 23 October and stayed there as the guest of Mrs. EnochTotten, who was a niece of Miss Howe, a friend of the Halesand of himself. (He had a great regard for Miss Howe, andoften, in his letters to the Hale sisters, asked them to give hisrespects to her. In a letter to Mary Hale, written from RidgelyManor during his second visit to America, he wrote as follows,September, 1899, \u201cWhere is Miss Howe? She is such a noblesoul, such a friend\u201d. About Mrs. Totten he wrote to Mrs. Bullon 27 October 1894, \u201cShe is an influential lady here and ametaphysician.\u201d) Swamiji does not seem to have come toWashington with a lecture programme in hand but, after hehad stayed there for about a week, delivered two lectures onSunday, 28 October at the invitation of the pastor of the People\u2019sChurch. The first lecture was given in the morning and,according to press report, dealt with the spiritual side of religion.He emphasized that all religions are good in their essence, beingdescended, like languages, from a common stock and that eachis good in its corporal and spiritual aspects so long as it is keptfree from dogma and fossilism. The second lecture, which wasdelivered in the afternoon, was more in the form of a lectureon the Aryan race and traced the descent of the various alliednationalities by their language, religion and customs from thecommon Sanskrit stock.On the same day a reporter of the Washington Postinterviewed Swamiji and on the following day the paperpublished a lengthy article, based on his report, dealing withSWAMIJI AT BALTIMORESWAMI VIVEKANANDA914some aspects of Swamiji\u2019s life and mission. It was to thisreporter that, so  far as our records go, for the first time SwamiVivekananda announced that he was \u201ca teacher to the world atlarge\u201d \u2014 a role which Sri Ramakrishna had long ago prophesiedthat his beloved Naren would have to assume in life. It isinteresting that this avowal came from him for the first time atWashington, the capital of the U.S.A., which was in a sensealso the capital, or one of the most important centres, of thepower of the materialist West. (It is probable that Swamiji\u2019sdeclaration \u2014 we do not know to whom or where made, \u2014 \u201cIhave a message to the West as Buddha had a message to theEast\u201d, vide, C.W., cited, V.214, belongs to this period.) To thisreporter who, like some others elsewhere, was curious to knowwhether there was any truth in the alleged miracle makingpowers of the Indian yogis, Swamiji gave his usual reply thathe was not interested in miracles and that while there were, ofcourse, a great many clever jugglers in the country, theirperformances were tricks. \u201cI am not a believer in miracles,\u201dsaid he, \u201cthey are repugnant to me in matters of religion. Youmight bring the world tumbling down about my ears, but thatwould be no proof to me that there was a God, or that youworked by his agency, if there was one\u201d. Swamiji talked withthis reporter on reincarnation which, he said, he acceptedbecause one must \u201cbelieve in a past and a hereafter as necessaryto the existence of the present\u201d. \u201cAnyone is welcome,\u201d addedhe, \u201cto deprive me of the theory of reincarnation provided hewill show me something better to replace it\u201d. On the samesubject he delivered a lecture on 1 November at Metzerott Hall.As said above, he then revisited Baltimore, where he deliveredtwo lectures on 2 and 5 November. Returning to Washingtonon 6 November, he delivered a lecture on the same day on\u201cGods of All Nations\u201d.915In a letter to Mary Hale from Washington, which bearsno date but, as the contents show, was written on 1 November1894, Swamiji said, \u201cI shall be in Philadelphia a few days onlyto see Prof. Wright, and then I go to New York and run for alittle while between New York and Boston, and then go toChicago via Detroit; and then `whist\u2019 \u2014 as Senator Palmersays, to England\u201d.76 It is likely that he did as he wrote, exceptfor the fact that the plan to visit England was not carried outtill about a year later in September, 1895. In a letter to IsabelleMcKindley written on his arrival for the first time in Washingtonand dated 26 (?) October 1894, he had said that a lady in Londonwith whom one of his friends was staying had invited him togo over to England and that, accordingly, he intended to visitthat country in January, or February, 1895. He was receivingurgent calls from India also to return, he had also said in thisletter. However, Swamiji left Washington for Philadelphia on7 November, and soon afterwards returned to New York, wherehe seems to have spent a good part of that month, during whichhe may have organized the society about which he wrote toAlasinga on 30 November. He may have also run for a littlewhile between New York and Boston and also visited Chicago,but the details of his whereabouts are not known.The first thing that is definitely known about Swamiji\u2019sactivities during this period is that he came to Cambridge on 5December and stayed at Mrs. Ole Bull\u2019s home there till 28December. He told Mary Hale, who at this time was at Boston,in a letter dated 8 December, that he was having a class everymorning \u201con Vedanta and other topics\u201d. His lectures and classes,as we learn from a statement by Dr. Lewis G. Janes, thePresident of the Brooklyn Ethical Association, \u201cwere attendedby people of the highest culture, including students of theUniversity\u201d77 who were helped \u201cat the solution of philosophicalAT WASHINGTON - ANOUNCEMENT OF WORLD MISSIONSWAMI VIVEKANANDA916problems in which they had become involved in the course oftheir study\u201d.78 They were, in a sense, a prelude to the highestintellectual honours  paid to Swamiji in America, that of beinginvited to speak before the Graduate Philosophical Society ofHarvard University on 25 March 1896 and, after his lecture on\u201cThe Vedanta Philosophy\u201d, of being offered the chair in EasternPhilosophy, a position which he declined. One day, said Swamijiin his letter to Mary Hale, referred to above, he dined with theSpaldings, who asked him, in spite of his repeated protests, tocriticize the Americans and did not relish it when he did so.\u201dHe seems to have expected that Mary, who at this time happenedto be at Boston, would pay him a visit and in his next letter toher80 suggested that she might come and meet Mrs. Ole Bulland his other friends. But though Mrs. Bull also wrote to herinviting her to come, that \u201cmettlesome Arab\u201d did not come.81In another letter, dated 21 December 1894, he informed herthat, if she could not come, he would meet her any day, sincethe lectures were at an end, except on the following Sunday,and he had time.82Among the lectures that Swamiji gave during this stayof his at Mrs. Ole Bull\u2019s home, was one delivered before agathering of prominent ladies on \u201cThe Ideals of Indian Women\u201d.At the end of his speech, in the course of which, as Mrs. Bulltells us, he gave these Ideals from the Vedas, from Sanskritliterature and the dramas, he paid his filial homage to his ownmother to whose unselfish love and charity, he said, he owedall that he had been able to accomplish in this world. So muchimpressed were the ladies of Cambridge who listened to hiswords, that, unknown to Swamiji, they sent to his mother, apicture of the Virgin Mother and the Child accompanied by aletter of profound salutations and respect. The letter, which isfound quoted in full in The Life83, read partly as follows, \u201cAt917this Christmas tide, when the gift of Mary\u2019s son to the world iscelebrated and rejoiced over with us, it would seem the time ofremembrance. We, who have your son in our midst, send  yougreetings. His generous service to men, women and childrenin our midst was laid at your feet by him, in an address he gaveus the other day on the Ideals of Motherhood in India. Theworship of his mother will be to all who heard him an inspirationand an uplift\u201d.As we learn from Mrs. Bull\u2019s letter, in the course of histalk, Swamiji had \u201ccited the laws of today favourable to thewomen of India\u201d. This can only mean that he spoke about theproperty laws of India, which gave women even better rightsthan those enjoyed by American women. As we know, this wasa point on which Swamiji probably dwelt in one of the veryfirst lectures that he gave in America, viz., before the RamabaiCircle at Boston on 21 August 1893 and also at Detroit, duringhis second visit to that city, at the latter place both in privatetalks and in a public lecture on 24 March 1894. While the ladiesat Cambridge were highly pleased with Swamiji\u2019s lecture andeven at Detroit there was little unfavourable comment, theRamabai Circle at Boston had been, as we have seen, mightilydispleased at his remarks. As we shall presently see, there wassoon to be a furore at Brooklyn over some statements like theabove respecting the property rights of Indian women made bySwamiji in a public lecture there. But before we take it up, wehave a pleasanter topic to deal with.VIIAs he said in his letter to Isabelle McKindley, dated 26 (?)October 1894, referred to above,84 he was receiving calls fromWITH MRS. BULL AT CAMBRIDGESWAMI VIVEKANANDA918India every day to return there. These came from some of hisbest friends, like the Maharaja of Khetri and the Dewan Sahebof Junagarh who genuinely believed that India urgently neededhis services, as also from some thoughtless people who saidthat he had had enough of lecturing which, according to them,was nothing but a fad of his and thought he should immediatelyreturn home. In a letter to Swami Brahmananda, as we haveseen,85 Swamiji had expressed his resentment at the advice thatthe latter kind of people were profuse in giving him. But to theformer he was quite openhearted and took considerable painsto explain why he wanted to stay in America for some timemore. Before we proceed to describe his further course inAmerica, it would not be irrelevant to give our readers an ideaof what Swamiji felt in the matter. This is clearly expressed inmany of his letters right from the time when he came toAmerica. \u201cWith a bleeding heart I have crossed half the worldto this strange land,\u201d wrote he to Alasinga, as early as 20 August1893, \u201cseeking for help\u201d.86 In his letter to Haripada Mitra dated28 December 1893, he had said, \u201cI came to this country not tosatisfy my curiosity, nor for name or fame, but to see if I couldfind any means for the support of the poor in India\u201d.87 Whilethe object of his coming to America is not fully disclosed inthese early statements of his \u2014 it was only gradually that itwas revealed and it was not till 28 October 1894 that, as wehave seen, he himself avowed his role of a world teacher thathad brought him to America \u2014 they firmly indicate that hewas to stay in the country as long as the purpose was notfulfilled.One may feel sure that many times, during the days hespent in America, in ceaselessly lecturing to the people, hismind had turned, as if drawn by a powerful magnet, to hismotherland, where much work awaited him and he almost919resolved to return to India. That he did not, or could not do sowas principally because, in the same manner that he had waitedfor a sign from On High that he should proceed to Americawhen Alasinga and others were pressing him in vain to makeup his mind to do so, he waited for another such command togo back to India. As early as 15 March 1894, as we know froma letter  of his to the Hale Sisters of that date, he was \u201cweariedof lecturing and all that nonsense\u201d and perhaps thinking ofleaving America soon.88 Again, on 21 September 1894, he wroteto Alasinga, \u201cI hope to return soon to India. I have had enoughof this country and especially as too much work is making menervous\u201d.89 These were, however, fleeting ideas, and his abidingfeeling on the subject had been expressed in a letter to Alasingaon 28 May 1894, as follows: \u201cI do not know when I am goingback to India. It is better to leave everything in the hands ofHim who is at my back directing me.\u201d90 Another reason whyhe stayed on in America was, one must note but notoveremphasize, (see Chapter 8, Section IV above), financial.In a letter to Swami Sivananda written in 1894 (exact date notstated) he said, \u201cI would have, before this, returned to India,but India has no money\u201d.91 He however, strongly deprecatedthe idea that any substantial aid for his work in India couldcome from America. He rebuked Alasinga for enquiring if afew thousand rupees annually could be safely expected to comefrom American sources. He said, \u201cYou do not deserve to live ifyou cannot help yourselves\u201d.92Whatever were his reasons for continuing his ministrationin America, India evidently was prominent in his thoughts,wherever physically he happened to be. He did not by any meansunderestimate his work for America; as to that, as he wrote toMr. E. T. Sturdy, considering himself as \u201cthe servant of thatGod who by the ignorant is called MAN,\u201d he had a sameGUIDELINES FOR THE WORK IN INDIASWAMI VIVEKANANDA920sightedness (samadrishti) for England, America, and India. On11 January 1895, he wrote to G.G., \u201cI shall work incessantlyuntil I die, and even after death I shall work for the good of theworld\u2026.. Know also that this (America) is grand field for myideas, and that I do not care whether they are Hindus orMohammedans or Christians, but those that love the Lord willalways command my service\u201d.93 He thought that what he wasdoing for America benefited India too, or even that by workingfor America he was working for India. This is clear from someobservations of his in his letters to India during this period. Hewrote to Alasinga in 1894 (exact date of the letter not known),\u201cMy little work here makes a big echo in India, do you know?So I shall not return there in a hurry. My intention is to dosomething permanent here and with that object I am workingday by day\u201d.94 Again, still more definitely, he wrote to him on29 September 1894, as follows, \u201cOur field is India, and thevalue of foreign appreciation is in rousing India up. That is all.. . We must have a strong base from which to spread. . Do notfor a moment quail. Everything will come all right. It is willthat moves the world\u201d.95 On 9 July 1895, he wrote to theMaharaja of Khetri, in reply perhaps to a letter from himenquiring when he was returning to India, \u201cAbout my comingto India, the matter stands thus. . I have planted a seed in thiscountry; it is already a plant, and I expect it to be a tree verysoon. I have got a few hundred followers. I shall make severalSannyasis and then I go to India, leaving the work to them\u201d.96He did not confine himself one to pious expressions ofhis opinion on the relative values of the work that he was doingin America and what he planned to do in India when he returnedto that country. His mind was constantly engaged in workingout plans for the uplift of the masses in India and, through alaborious correspondence, was not only urging his disciples921and friends there to carry them out but keeping watch on thelatter as they did so. He sent out flaming calls to them for serviceto the motherland, checked the progress that was beingachieved, advised, implored, rebuked them as needed, andoccasionally sent them any money that he could spare out ofthe meagre fund that he built up by his superhuman toil inAmerica. Romain Rolland has said that he was \u2018a born king\u2019and that \u2018within him there was a Napoleon\u2019 and one who readshis messages (which thrilled the French savant like an electricshock even at a thirty years\u2019 distance), or ponders over what hewas doing for India from far-off America cannot but feel that aking, or even a Napoleon, could hardly do the task better. Hiswork for India did not have to await his arrival, and hislieutenants had a considerable achievement in the field alreadyto their credit when he returned to India.We need not detain our readers with a narration of thedetails of his plans right here, but we may indicate their generaloutlines as they may be gathered from some of his letters ofthis period from which we give some extracts below. The veryfirst letter that he wrote to his disciples at Madras \u2014 that waseven before he reached America \u2014 contained the followingexhortation to them, \u201cDo you love man? Do you love yourcountry? Then come, let us struggle for higher and better things;look not back, no, not even if you see the dearest and nearestcry. Look not back, but forward. India wants the sacrifice of atleast a thousand of her young men \u2014 men, mind, and notbrutes\u201d.97 On 24 January 1894 he again wrote to them,\u201cRemember that the nation lives in the cottages. . Can yougive them (the masses) back their lost individuality withoutmaking them lose their innate spiritual nature?\u201d98 In his veryfirst letter to his gurubhais in Calcutta, he suggested thateducation should be brought to the very doors of the masses.GUIDELINES FOR THE WORK IN INDIASWAMI VIVEKANANDA922\u201cIf the mountain does not come to Mohammed, Mohammedmust go to the mountain\u201d, wrote he.99 He thought that somesannyasis could go from village to village, disseminatingeducation among the masses \u201cdown to the Chandalas\u201d by meansof cameras, globes and other accessories. He repeated thesesuggestions in his letter to the Maharaja of Mysore referred toabove. He expected the youth of the nation  to come forwardand dedicate their lives to the cause. In his very first letter tohis Madrasi disciples, as we have said above, he had expressedthis idea. On 28 May 1894, he again wrote to Alasinga, \u201cTrainup a body of fiery young men\u201d.100 The response was not as hehad expected and he wrote again to Dr. Nanjunda Rao on 30November 1894, \u201cA few young men have jumped in the breach,have sacrificed themselves. They are a few; we want a fewthousands of such as they, and they will come\u201d.101 He viewedwith alarm Swami Ramakrishnananda\u2019s preference forceremonial worship (they differed on this subject since theBaranagore Math days) and, in a number of letters to him,expressed himself strongly on the subject. In a letter written in1894 (exact date not known), he wrote to his gurubhais asfollows, \u201cIf you want any good to come, just throw yourceremonials overboard, and worship the living God, the ManGod \u2014 every being that wears a human form \u2014 God in hisuniversal as well as an individual aspect\u201d.102VIIIIn a letter to the Hale Sisters from Greenacre dated 11 August1894,103 Swami Vivekananda said, \u201cThere is my friend Dr. Janesof New York, President of the Ethical Culture Society, whohas begun his lectures. I must go to hear him. He and I agree somuch\u201d. This Dr. Janes, to whom we have referred a few times923already in the preceding pages, was one of the not very fewAmericans whom Swamiji could count upon as being hisgenuine friends and who remained such from the day they firstmet and till death. Their friendship transcended intellectualkinship, for though Swamiji said that they agreed \u201cso much\u201d,Dr. Janes was a Spenserian and a staunch defender of the theoryof evolution, which Swamiji believed in his youth and had leftfar behind long since. However, Dr. Janes who, like his master,Herbert Spencer, was largely self-educated, was a free-lancein the field of philosophical views, and like Dr. William Jamesand others, who differed from Swamiji in their philosophicalviews, and yet were greatly attracted to him, found in Swamijia true kinship in the domain of the spirit. In 1885, Dr. Janeshad founded the Brooklyn Ethical Association mentioned asthe Ethical Culture Society by Swamiji in his letter to the HaleSisters, which became famous as a defender of Spenserianphilosophy which, by the way, ran against some orthodoxChristian ideas, e.g., the Biblical doctrine of special creation.His liberal views had prompted him to participate in theGreenacre Conference where he had met, admired, and formeda friendship with Swamiji. It is possible that this friendshipresulted in a further broadening of his intellectual sympathies,so that later he accepted the post of director of the MonsalvatSchool of Comparative Religions at Greenacre. Later still, in1889, he was elected president of the Free ReligiousAssociation, upon the retirement of Col. Higginson.It was probably during their days of meeting with eachother at Greenacre that Dr. Janes had told Swamiji about hisintention to invite him to deliver a series of lectures before theBrooklyn Ethical Association. The date of the opening lecture,viz., 30 December 1894, seems to have been fixed andcommunicated to Swamiji by 8 December, since we find thatGUIDELINES FOR THE WORK IN INDIASWAMI VIVEKANANDA924in his letter to Mary Hale of that date Swamiji says that hewould stay at Cambridge till 27 or 28 December. After Swamijileft Greenacre, he does not seem to have had very pressingengagements except one, viz., Mrs. Bagley\u2019s invitation to himto come to Annisquam, and it is rather curious that the EthicalAssociation took such a long time (nearly four months) toextend their invitation to him to come and speak before them.It is probable that a professedly intellectual body withpronounced Spenserian ideology had some hesitation aboutinviting one  whom some members may have considered as areligious preacher who, as such, was opposed to their agnosticline of thought. In any case, it seems, before they actually invitedhim, they made very careful enquires about his antecedents,on the basis of which an officer of the Association, Mr. CharlesM. Higgins, prepared a ten page pamphlet which was circulated,as we know from the title page, \u201camong those interested in thestudy of Oriental Religions\u201d.104 One might think that it wasrather fortunate that they did so for, when, as we shall seepresently, soon afterwards, the Ramabai Circle raised a furoreover some remarks of Swamiji in one of his lectures at thePouch Mansion, it enabled Dr. Janes to reply to them andsubstantiate his arguments with facts about Swamiji, with whichhe seemed to be very well posted.Be that as it may, Swamiji arrived at New York on 28December and proceeded at once to Brooklyn to attend areception arranged in his honour the same evening by Mr.Charles M. Higgins at his own residence in the city. Mr. Higginswho, as we have seen, had compiled and distributed aninformative pamphlet about Swamiji \u201cas a sort of forerunner\u201dto his coming lectures before the Association, had also inviteda reporter of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle to his party, expectingthat the latter would give Swamiji further publicity. It came925about as he had planned, for on 30 December, the day ofSwamiji\u2019s lecture that paper came out in the morning with anarticle on Swamiji. This article, which embodied an accountof Swamiji by G. G. Narasimhachariar of Madras, rousedconsiderable enthusiasm about him among the public, as isevidenced by the fact that his lecture which was delivered inthe evening was attended by as many as 800 persons whobelonged to all professions and callings. The place of themeeting was the Pouch Mansion (since demolished), whichcontained a large lecture hall, a gallery, and adjoining parlours,all of which were packed to overflowing. The subject was \u201cTheReligions of India,\u201d and admission was free. Even the sponsorsof the meeting had not expected that an oriental religious subjectsuch as the one on which Swamiji was to speak would exciteso great an interest among the general public. They werepleasantly surprised when, at the close of the evening, therewas an insistent demand for more such lectures. Swamijigraciously acceded and the Brooklyn Ethical Association, aswe shall presently see, announced a further programme oflectures.More or less lengthy reports of Swamiji\u2019s lecture on \u201cTheReligions of India\u201d appeared not only in the Brooklyn papersof 31 December but in the New York Tribune of the same dateand the Rutherford American. The portion of the BrooklynStandard Union article on the subject that contained a summaryof the lecture is found reproduced in C.W.105 under the caption,\u201cHindu Religion\u201d. The descriptive portions, which were foundin the earlier editions of this work and have been omitted inthe latest one, have been quoted in full in Mrs. Burke\u2019s work.In the last mentioned book are also found reproduced in fullthe reports of the lecture that appeared in the Brooklyn Timesand the Brooklyn Daily Eagle. All these articles containedGUIDELINES FOR THE WORK IN INDIASWAMI VIVEKANANDA926brilliant pen pictures of Swamiji, which we refrain from quotinghere, since they resemble, often in the very wordings,descriptions of Swamiji given by earlier reporters, which havebeen reproduced in the previous pages of this work. We,however, quote here in full descriptions of Swamiji and of themeeting there as given in the first two and the last paragraphsof an article on the meeting that appeared in the RutherfordAmerican, which are not to be found in any of the worksmentioned above.Mrs. Burke has mentioned that another version of thesame lecture by Swamiji, which differs in wording from but isthe same in essence as the one reproduced in C.W., I, is foundreproduced C.W., IV under the caption \u201cIndian ReligiousThought\u201d. We find that this version is no other than the onegiven in the Rutherford American article mentioned by usabove. The entire article was reproduced in a small pamphlet,entitled \u201cAnother Version of the Lecture at Brooklyn\u201d whichwas published about the year 1896 by Satyacharan Mitra, ason of Haramohan Mitra, a boyhood\u2019s friend of Swamiji. Amoth-eaten copy of this pamphlet has recently come into ourpossession through the courtesy of another son of HaramohanMitra, Sri Bholanath Mitra who, aged 77, still (in 1970) runsthe Orphan Press, at which this pamphlet had been printednearly three quarters of a century ago by his elder brother. Werefrain from quoting here in full the summary of the lecturegiven by the Rutherford American, and shall give only theleading ideas, since it is readily available to our readers, whomay turn for it to C. W. But we give here in full the descriptiveportions of the article, which covers first two and the lastparagraphs, and, at this writing (1970), is not to be found inany work known to us.927The headings of the article run thus. WISDOM OF THEORIENT, SWAMI VIVEKANANDA, THE HINDU MONK/LECTURES IN BROOKLYN ON \u201cTHE RELIGIONS OFINDIA\u201d. Then follows the article. The first paragraph is asfollows. \u201cIt was an unusual attraction which induced twomembers of `The Research Club\u2019 on the last Sunday eveningof the old year, to brave the rigour of a keen north wind and thediscomfort of a long tramp over the frozen snow, in a journeyto Brooklyn. The attraction was an opportunity to listen to alecture from Swami Vivekananda, the Hindu monk, whoseeloquent and thoughtful discourses before the Parliament ofReligions at the Chicago fair, made such a profound impression,not only on the audience who listened to him, but on theReligious world generally\u201d. The second paragraph, which dealswith the nature of the meeting and the personality of the speaker,is as follows, \u201cThe lecture of December 30 was delivered underthe auspices of `The Brooklyn Ethical Society,\u2019 and the meetingwas held at the Pouch Mansion, before an audience whichcrowded the large and stately hall and adjoining parlours, andwhich was representative of the highest intellectual and socialculture of Brooklyn. The speaker was introduced by Dr. LewisG. Janes, and he presented a very picturesque appearance whenhe stood up to deliver his lecture. He was attired in Orientalgarb, consisting of a scarlet robe of soft cloth which reachedbelow the knees, and bound round the waist with a crimsongirdle. On his head was a turban of white silk, which set off toadvantage the swarthy complexion of his cleanly shaven face.His features are regular, his lips full, but the expression of hismouth refined and eloquent; while his eyes are large and dark,full of Oriental languor when in repose, but lighting up with avery earnest and intellectual look when animated by the playof lofty thoughts. His voice is soft and low, with a singularlyliquid and musical quality, and his pronunciation is marked byTHE BROOKLYN LECTURESSWAMI VIVEKANANDA928a slightly foreign accent, which is rather pleasant thanotherwise. Altogether his personality is one, which is likely tolinger long in our memory. His lecture showed that he was acomplete master of the English language, which he must haveacquired in early youth\u201d.The last paragraph, which describes the impression thatthe two reporters carried with them, as they left the PouchMansion at the close of the meeting, runs thus. \u201cAs mycompanion and I wended our way homeward, the vast vault ofthe blue sky was studded with stars, and the blessed fragranceof Christmas still lingered in the streets of the great city. Wethought of the old and beautiful legend of the Eastern Magiwho followed the star which led them, with their homage offrankincense and myrrh, to the babe lying in the manger ofBethlehem. And we wondered if this Oriental wanderer wasnot one of the same high caste, who 1900 years later had cometo our Western Continent to throw light upon the inner meaningof that pure gospel, which that noble soul had preached andillustrated\u201d.Swamiji began his lecture with giving his listeners anidea of the size of India as compared with the United States,and of the religions professed by the inhabitants. He thenproceeded to give an exposition of the cardinal features of theHindu religion. He said it was founded on the Vedas, whichassert that the universe is infinite in space and eternal induration. The passage of time makes no mark whatever on thedial of eternity. The Vedas teach that the soul of man isimmortal; the body is subject to the law of growth and decay,but the indwelling spirit never had a beginning and it will neverhave an end. Here Hinduism differs from Christianity; the latterteaches that each human soul has its beginning, on its entrance,929on the birth of the body into this world, while the former assertsthat the spirit of the men is an emanation of the eternal being,and has no more beginning than God himself. Then why do wenot remember anything of our past lives? The answer is:consciousness is the name of the surface only of the mentalocean; within its depths are stored up all our experiences.He referred to the contention of the Buddhists thateverything that cannot be solved by the five senses isnonexistent: and the counterclaim of the idealists that theexternal world does not exist outside the individual\u2019s mentalconception. He thought that a sure solution of this problem isthat nature is a mixture of dependence and independence, ofreality and idealism. Our minds and bodies are dependent uponthe nature of their relation to the external world, but theindwelling spirit is free, as God is free, and is able to direct ina greater or less degree, according to the attitude of theirdevelopment, the movements of our minds and bodies. Death,he went on to say, was but a change of condition. We remain inthe same universe, and subject to the same laws as before. Thosewho have passed beyond and have attained high planes ofdevelopment in beauty and wisdom are but the advance guardof a universal army, who are following after. The spirit of thehighest is related to the spirit of the lowest, and the germ ofinfinite perfection exists in all.The object of life is to learn the laws of spiritual progress.Hindus and Christians can learn from each other, each havingmade a contribution to the wisdom of the world. He could seethe esoteric meaning of his own Bible better after studyingtheirs, he said. We would offer to God a bouquet of the mostbeautiful colours of all the diverse faiths. Every humanpersonality might be compared to a glass globe. There is theTHE BROOKLYN LECTURESSWAMI VIVEKANANDA930same pure light \u2014 an emission of the divine being \u2014 in thecentre of each, but the glass being of different colours andthickness, the rays assume diverse aspects in the transmission.The equality and beauty of each central flame is the same, theapparent inequality is only in the imperfection of the temporalinstrument of its expression. As we rise higher and higher inthe scale of being, the medium becomes more and moretranslucent. Religion is positive and not negative; it does notconsist in merely refraining from vileness, but in a persistentperformance of noble deeds. Books are only maps, they maypoint the way to a higher life, but no good results unless thepath is trodden with unflinching steps.After the lecture, an opportunity was given to anyone inthe audience to ask questions relative to the subject of thediscourses and many availed themselves of the offer. A ladyasked how he reconciled his thoroughly optimistic views withthe existence of evil, with the universal presence of sorrowand pain. In reply he said he would endeavour to answer thequestion if the existence of evil were first proved; but this theVedantic religion would not admit. Eternal pain unmixed withpleasure would be a positive evil but temporal pain and sorrow,if after the passage they have contributed an element oftenderness and nobility of eternal bliss, are not evils. In replyto a question whether the cosmic entity of matters around uswas not simply imaginings of our own minds, he said that theexternal world was certainly an entity and had an existenceoutside of our mental conceptions. All creation is movingonward and upward, obedient to the great law of spiritevolution, which is different from the evolution of matter. Thelatter is symbolical of but does not explain the process of theformer. We are not individuals now, in our present earthlyenvironment. We will not have reached individuality until we931ascended to the higher state, when the divine spirit within usshall have a perfect medium for the expression of its attributes.In reply to another question, asking for his explanationof the problem that had been presented to Christ, as to whetherit was the infant himself, or his parents, who had sinned thathe was born blind, he answered as follows. While the questionof sin did not enter into the problem in his mind, he wasconvinced that the blindness was due to some act on the partof the spirit of the child in a previous incarnation. In his opinion,such problems were only explicable on the hypothesis of aprior earthly existence. When asked as to whether our spiritspassed at death into a state of happiness, he replied that deathwas only a change of condition. Time and space are in you,said he, you are not in time and space. It is enough to knowthat, as we make our lives purer and nobler, the nearer weapproach God who is the centre of all spiritual beauty andeternal joy.106As we have said above, in response to the insistentdemand for more lectures from Swamiji, the Ethical Associationhad arranged for them. As announced in a bulletin issued bythem,107 the lectures were to be held at the Pouch Gallery ondates as follows: 20 January 1895 \u2014 \u201cIdeals of Womanhood,Hindu, Mohammedan and Christian\u201d; 3 February 1895 \u2014\u201cBuddhism as understood in India\u201d; 17 February, 1895 \u2014 \u201cTheVedas and Religion of the Hindus. What is Idolatry?\u201d Theadmission to the lectures was to be on a small charge (Coursetickets, $ 1.00, Single admission 50 cents) \u2014 the proceeds tobe for \u201cthe joint benefit of the Swami Vivekananda\u2019sEducational Work, and the Publication Fund of the EthicalAssociation\u201d. This programme was followed, with theexception that the lecture, entitled \u201cThe Vedas and Religion ofTHE BROOKLYN LECTURESSWAMI VIVEKANANDA932the Hindus, What is Idolatry?\u201d, which was scheduled on 17February was not delivered. Instead, he spoke on \u201cIndia\u2019s Giftto the World\u201d on 25 February. Under the auspices of the EthicalAssociation also, Swamiji gave an \u201cIntroductory Lecture andConversation\u201d at the parlours of Mrs. Charles Auel on 25January 1895, as \u201cPreliminary to the formation of a Class forthe Exposition and Study of the Upanishads and Yogic Doctrine,as taught and practised by the Sages of India\u201d. The subject ofthis lecture and conversation was \u201cThe Upanishads and theDoctrine of the Soul.\u201d108 As may be inferred from a statementin Landsberg\u2019s letter to Isabelle McKindley dated 26 January1895,109 Swamiji gave another conversation at the same parlouron 29 January 1895. Possibly he gave other parlour lecturesand talks of which we have no records at present. Swamiji\u2019slast public lecture at Brooklyn, also delivered under the auspicesof the Ethical Association, at the Pouch Gallery, was on 7 April1895, and was entitled, \u201cSome Customs of the Hindus\u201d. [Itwill be noticed that between the first lecture of Swamiji(delivered on 30 December 1894) and his second lecture(delivered on 20 January 1895) there was a gap of three weeks.He spent this time at Chicago at the Hales\u2019 home.110]As announced, Swamiji delivered his second lecture on\u201cThe Ideals of Womanhood \u2014 Hindu, Mohammedan, andChristian\u201d at the Pouch Mansion on 20 January 1895. At thevery outset of the lecture, as reported in the Standard Union inits issue of the following day, Swamiji stated that his purposewas solely to present the ideal side, the broad, general tendencyof the respective civilizations with reference to social purityand the position of women. \u201cThe product of the slums of anynation,\u201d said he, \u201ccannot be the criterion of our judgment ofthat nation. One may collect the rotten, worm-eaten applesunder every apple tree in the world, and write a book about933each of them, and still know nothing of the beauty andpossibilities of the apple tree. Only in the highest and best canwe judge a nation \u2014 the fallen are a race by themselves. Thusit is not only proper, but just and right, to judge a custom by itsbest, by its ideal\u201d. He referred to the Vedic Ideal \u2014 which heldtrue also in ancient Greece and Rome \u2014 of the wife assahadharmini (partner in religious life) and proceeded to showhow, under the influence of doctrines held by the Semitic racesthat denied women a voice, or any rights, the co-priesthood ofthe woman in all these nations stepped back. In India, however,said he, side by side with these excrescences, a very intenseideal of personal purity sprang up in the nation. It developedinto almost a mania, as instanced by the self-immolation of74,500 women on the funeral pyre by Rajput women at Chittore,to save themselves from dishonour at the hands of the enemywho had captured the city. (Swamiji incidentally referred tothe Indian custom of writing the words, 74,500, on every letter,implying that any man who unlawfully read the letter becameguilty of a  crime similar to the one which the noble women ofChittore forestalled by choosing death.)There was a further deterioration in the position ofwomen with the advent of Buddhism, which taught that onlythe monks could reach the \u2018nirvana\u2019. India became a hugemonastery; there was but one object, one battle \u2014 to remainpure. All the blame was cast onto women, and even the proverbswarned against them. \u201cThe same idea is to be found in thecloisters of the West. The development of monasticism alwaysmeant the degeneration of women\u201d. Eventually, however,another idea of womanhood arose: in the West it found its idealin the wife, in India in the mother. This change was not broughtabout by the priests but, in the West, by men like John StuartMill and the revolutionary philosophers. \u201cReligion has doneTHE BROOKLYN LECTURESSWAMI VIVEKANANDA934something, no doubt,\u201d said Swamiji, \u201cbut not all. Why, in AsiaMinor, Christian bishops to this day keep a harem!\u201d TheChristian ideal is that which is found in the Anglo-Saxon race.The Mohammedan woman differs vastly from her Westernsisters in so far as her social and intellectual development isnot so pronounced. But she is by no means unhappy. In India,woman has enjoyed property rights since thousands of years.In America a man may disinherit his wife, in India the wholeestate of the deceased husband must go to the wife, personalproperty absolutely, real property for life.In India the mother is the centre of the family and ourhighest ideal. She is to us the representative of God, as God isthe mother of the universe. It was a female sage who first foundthe unity of God, and laid down this doctrine in the first hymnsof the Vedas. Our God is both personal and absolute; theabsolute is male, the personal, and female. And thus it comesthat we now say: \u201cThe first manifestation of God is the handthat rocks the cradle. He is of the Aryan race, who is bornthrough prayer, and he is a Non Aryan, who is born throughsensuality. So deeply this idea has been recognized in Indiathat there they even speak of adultery in marriage, except whenmarriage is consummated in prayer. And I and every good Hindubelieve that my mother was pure and holy, and hence I owe hereverything I am. That is the secret of the race \u2014 chastity.\u201cThe Ideals of Womanhood\u201d was a favourite subject ofSwamiji\u2019s on which he talked many times \u2014 receiving thewarmest appreciation of his audiences in many places wherehe spoke, such as recently at Cambridge. In many of hisspeeches too, as he did at Brooklyn, he began with the Vedicideals of Indian womanhood and ended with paying a tributeto his own mother \u2014 on certain occasions also correcting935mistaken notions about the status of Hindu women by referenceto women\u2019s property rights in India. His ideas on the subjectwere comprehensively dealt within a lecture that he deliveredat Pasadena during his second visit to America, which is foundfully reproduced in C.W., VIII, 5372. At Brooklyn, as he wroteto Isabelle McKindley on 24 January 1895, his speech was not\u201cvery much appreciated by the men but awfully so by thevemen\u201d. Not all the \u201cvemen\u201d, however, appreciated his speechwhich, though Swamiji did not as yet know, was stronglyresented by the ladies of the Ramabai Circle at Brooklyn as hisspeech at Boston on 21 August 1893 had been by the ladies ofthe Circle there. The anger of these good ladies of Brooklynwas to become known to him and to the public five weekslater when a controversy began in the columns of the DailyEagle over his remarks about the property rights of Indianwomen. We shall deal with it later.We do not know anything about what Swamiji said inhis parlour talks but we have a good idea of what he spoke on\u201cBuddhism\u201d in his third lecture at Brooklyn on 3 February1895, since it was reported fairly extensively in the BrooklynStandard Union on the following day. It was the most eloquentand impressive of all the speeches he had delivered in the city,said the reporter, who paid him the further compliment of beingone who spoke not as a paid exponent of a peculiar system ofphilosophy but as \u201can apostle, preaching a creed which hasbecome a part of his very self\u201d. The large audience, says thereporter, was held \u201cspellbound with the fascinating earnestnessof his speech\u201d. Buddha, said Swamiji, antagonized theadherents of the prevailing religion of India as Jesusantagonized the Jews, but while Christ was rejected by hiscountrymen, Buddha was accepted as God incarnate in India.\u201cNot, however, the creed which bears his name\u201d, SwamijiTHE BROOKLYN LECTURESSWAMI VIVEKANANDA936quickly added. Every one of Buddha\u2019s teachings, he explained,is founded in the Vedanta, but as his doctrines spread to otherlands which were as yet not prepared for the reception of hisideas, they came back tainted with the foibles of the peoples ofthose lands. Thus arose the nihilistic doctrine, which is ahorrible degeneration of what Buddha had taught. Swamijiconcluded his lecture with the presentation of a few picturesfrom the life of Buddha, \u201cthe great one, who never thought athought and never performed a deed except for the good ofothers, who had the greatest intellect and heart, taking in allmankind and all the animals, all embracing ready to give uphis life for the highest angels, as well as for the lowest worm\u201d.111IXFrom the loftiness of these ideas we have, unfortunately, toturn to the ugliness of the controversy that the ladies of theBrooklyn Centre of the Ramabai Circle raised about the positionof widows in India. In his lecture on 20 January 1895 on the\u201cIdeals of Womanhood \u2014 Hindu, Mohammedan, andChristian\u201d, Swamiji had said nothing about the social positionor condition of Indian widows. But, as we have seen, he hadspoken about the legal rights of Indian women, includingwidows, to property which, these good ladies thought, had abearing on and contradicted the views they held about the plightof widows, particularly child widows, in India. In an earlierChapter, we have spoken about the Ramabai Circles in America,which owed their origin to the visit to that country of PanditaRamabai and her appeal to Americans for monetary help forestablishing and perpetuating a school for child widows in India.The cause that she advocated was a noble one, but not alwayssuch were the methods she adopted for raising funds in America,or the motives of those who came forward to her help. As one937who had a personal knowledge of the sufferings of child widows\u2014 having herself become a widow once in childhood beforeshe married again later in her youth and was widowed a secondtime \u2014 she was taken as one who was competent to presenther case and could be relied upon to give a true picture of thecondition of Indian widows.Unfortunately, in her statement of her case, Ramabai hadmixed some truth with many exaggerations and distortions offacts. The picture she drew of child widows of India in herlectures in America and her book, \u201cThe High-caste HinduWoman\u201d was so overdrawn as to make it unworthy of credenceof all except only those who wanted to make capital out of it intheir own interests. The latter consisted of, firstly, the Christianmissionaries who found in her statements about the conditionof Hindu society further arguments for denouncing Hinduismand Indian culture in general, and bringing to the heathen thegospel of Christ by methods which had begun to be exposedand discredited even in their own country. Secondly, there wasa class of American women, newly awakened to the rights ofsex who were in search of noble causes which they couldespouse and serve in their own way. Among these also therewas a distinctive  variety, \u201cthe churchwomen\u201d or \u201cthechurchies\u201d (as Swami Vivekananda called them), whopatronized the missionaries and were in return applauded andblessed by them and who, as Swamiji said, were \u201cawfulfanatics\u201d, working hand in hand with the missionaries in thenoble cause of saving the heathens\u2019 souls. These \u201ctitanesses\u201d(as he called them) were his sworn enemies, who has noscruples about manufacturing scandals about him and were tobe on the warpath against him again.THE BROOKLYN LECTURESSWAMI VIVEKANANDA938As we have said above, in his lecture on 20 January 1895,Swamiji had said nothing about the social position of Indianwidows \u2014 neither about them in general nor about theparticular class of them in whom the good ladies of the RamabaiCircle were specially interested, viz., child widows. Theaggressiveness of these ladies was perhaps chiefly due to thefact that, ever since he had spoken before this Circle at Boston,they had a black mark put against him in their books. Theynow found that he had said something which, howeverindirectly, touched them and so provided them with a welcomecasus belli against him. We may guess that they were egged onto the task by their missionary friends and also that thecontroversy was lengthened out by the newspapers for noworthier reason than their own need for more copy. As willappear in the following narrative, some of the newspapers werenot free from bias, which was shown by giving incompletereports of statements made by one party, viz., Swamiji, andeven falsifying the date of a letter from Dr. Janes and publishingit later which had the effect of making him appear as havingmade a false statement. We may mention that, as elsewhere soalso in his controversy with his critics at Brooklyn, Swamijidid not take a direct part in the exchange of words in the press,which was done mainly between Mrs. James McKeen, thePresident of the Brooklyn  Ramabai Circle and Dr. Lewis G.Janes, the President of the Ethical Association.The opening shot in the wordy duel was fired by Mrs.McKeen with a statement to a reporter of the Daily Eagle on23 February 1895, which was published in the hospitablecolumns of that paper on the following day. She challengedthe accuracy of a statement which, she alleged, had been madepublicly by \u201cone entitled to know of what he speaks\u201d, to theeffect that no such class of persons as child widows, for whose939aid her Circle was raising funds in America, at all existed inIndia. (The reference obviously was to Swamiji\u2019s speech at thePouch mansion on 20 January 1895.) She refrained frommentioning Swamiji personally by name, or stating where hehad made the statement as we shall find later not out of charitybut for a certain purpose that will appear presently. That shedid not name Swamiji, however, did not save him from beinghauled to the dock immediately for, besides giving out his nameas that of the person who had made the statement that hadbeen taken exception to by Mrs. McKeen, the paper put certainthings into his mouth, as had also been done by the lady in herstatement, which were not to be found in the version ofSwamiji\u2019s speech of 20 January 1895, that had appeared in theStandard Union, referred to by us above. In a prefatoryparagraph, the paper (the Daily Eagle) said, \u201cA sharp issue hasarisen between certain persons in this city, who are interestedin Christian work in India, and Swami Vivekananda, a Hindumonk now in Brooklyn, on the question of the sufferings ofchild widows in India. Swami Vivekananda denied, in a lecturein the Pouch Mansion a fortnight ago, that widows of highcaste Hindus undergo suffering. High caste Hindu widows are,he said, especially protected by law. This statement is held bymany  persons to be open to question, and especially by thosewho are members of the Brooklyn Ramabai Circle\u201d.As we have said above, in her statement to the reporterof the Daily Eagle, Mrs. McKeen had accused Swamiji (withoutnaming him) of having denied that \u201csuch a class as that forwhich\u201d the Ramabai Circle had appealed to the American publicfor funds, Viz., child widows, existed in India. She still believed,she had said in that statement, that there was much sufferingamong the child widows of India, and she had cited witnessesin support of her statement. The first among them was PanditaSWAMIJI AND THE RAMABAI LADIES OF BROOKLYNSWAMI VIVEKANANDA940Ramabai herself whose probity, said she, was vouched for bythose who had known her for many years, among whom shementioned Max Muller. Among other witnesses she cited wasa Mrs. J. W. Adams of Boston, who had been sent by theRamabai Association to India to look after its work, and wrotefrom Poona the following \u201cstirring words,\u201d \u201cWe have been toldthat the life of the child widow is not as hard and pitiless asrepresented. Why, then, are the shaven heads and the bodiesemaciated and disfigured by starvation and cruel blows?. Whyso many suicides and lives of shame among the child widows?\u201dThe lady went on to say that those who believed that the girlwidows had happy homes should come to the Sharada Ashram(the nondenominational school for child widows at Poona,founded by Pandita Ramabai, for which subscriptions werebeing raised in America), and see the girls and hear their stories.Let them, said she, \u201csee the white marks of the hot iron on thehead, the little white scars made by sharp fingernails meetingthe tender flesh of the face,\u201d and so on.On the very day that Dr. Janes read Mrs. McKeen\u2019sstatement in the Daily Eagle, he wrote a reply and sent it tothat paper for immediate publication. The latter held it up,falsified the date (24 February), converting it to 3 March, andpublished it on 6 March. The motive will soon appear. However,as to the contentions of Dr. Janes in his letter, they were, firstly,that Swamiji had not denied \u2014 either in his speech at the PouchMansion, or in any public speech or private talk anywhere \u2014that widows of high caste Hindus undergo suffering. His onlyallusion to Hindu widows, said he, \u201cwas brief and whollyincidental to the main topic of his discourse, and referredexclusively to the property rights of high caste widows underthe Hindu law. Secondly, said he, Swamiji had made it clear inhis introductory remarks that his purpose was solely to present941the ideal case, and that he did not propose to speak about the\u201cthe nether side\u201d, which \u2014 an aspect of degradation \u2014 existedin India as in other countries. \u201cIt would be as unjust\u201d, pleadedDr. Janes, \u201cto judge India by the nether side as to judge Americaby the revelations of the Pankhurst investigation and the LexowCommittee\u201d.It would have been wise of Dr. Janes if he had finishedhis letter here with his factual correction, which wasunanswerable and was answered, as we shall presently see,only by recourse to unworthy methods. But the good Doctor\u2019slove and respect for his friend prompted him to make an attemptto vindicate Swamiji further by throwing some light, as he said,on his real attitude towards the philanthropic movement inwhich the good ladies of the Ramabai Circle were so deeplyinterested. In doing so, he made certain statements which wereseemingly irrelevant and gave his opponents a chance oflengthening out the dialogue, as also of criticising him and hisfriend. He said that Swami Vivekananda had personally toldhim that it was not the object aimed at by Pandita Ramabaithat he criticized but the methods adopted by her for collectingmoney. In this connection he referred to the work of reformthat was being carried on \u201cquietly and assiduously\u201d for the lastthirty years by Babu Sasipada Banerjee of Baranagore, \u201chimselfa Hindu\u201d, in defiance of current  prejudices, with his own goodwife as a helper. Swami Vivekananda, added him, was his(Banerjee\u2019s) friend and believed in his work.Dr. Janes then went on to make certain statements aboutPandita Ramabai and the school she had founded at Poona,obviously with the object of proving that they provided acontrast. The fact that the Pandita was a Christian convert, heasserted, was enough to repel a great majority of even liberalSWAMIJI AND THE RAMABAI LADIES OF BROOKLYNSWAMI VIVEKANANDA942minded Hindus from encouraging her activities. Clearly, theirpride prevented them from being recipient of favours renderedpossible by the solicitation of money in distant countries frompeople professing an alien faith. As regards the Pandita\u2019s work,said he, it has been impossible to meet with even a smallmeasure of success except by the assurance that her schoolwas absolutely non-Christian and that no efforts towardsproselyting would be tolerated therein. Even then, said he, asuspicion having arisen some time back that this rule was indanger, it led to the resignation of all the members of the boardof advisers, which consisted of liberal minded high casteHindus.Dr. Janes then proceeded to pay a noble compliment toSwamiji, going perhaps out of his way in doing so, or perhapsbeing prompted to do so because there had been some recentcriticisms of Swamiji which we do not know about and whichhe considered it to be his bounden duty to counteract. Whetherwhat he said here was relevant to his immediate purpose inwriting his letter to the paper or not, in a biography of Swamijiit deserves to be quoted in extenso, especially because itindicates what a man of Dr. Janes\u2019s intellectual eminencethought of the nature and purpose of Swamiji\u2019s work inAmerica. Said Dr. Janes, \u201cThat the practice of SwamiVivekananda, while in this country, has been consistent withthis high conception of duty I have had occasion to know.Though he has at heart a noble enterprise for the education ofthe religious teachers of his own faith in sociology, economicsand the better things in our Western civilization, he has madeabsolutely no effort to solicit subscriptions for this purpose.Nor will he accept one penny for his work as a teacher; noreven for this larger work, save as a voluntary, free will offeringfrom people of calm judgment, intellectually convinced of the943importance of the work. In Brooklyn he has absolutely declinedto hold classes where an admission is charged, even for thepurpose of paying the expenses of the room and the advertising.For himself he accepts from public lectures only what isnecessary for travelling expenses and his food, clothing andlodging, from week to week. I personally know of one instancewhere he returned to an enthusiastic admirer a check for $ 500,freely given, declining to receive it because he did not need it,and feared the donor was carried away with undue enthusiasm.Those who know the Swami Vivekananda best write intestimony to his nobility of character, and the purity andelevation of his daily life. .\u201dDr. Janes\u2019s categorical denial that Swamiji had made anysuch statement about the condition of Hindu widows as hadbeen attributed to him in the issue of the Daily Eagle of 24February, placed the editor of the paper in a tight corner. Thelatter wriggled out of the difficulty by a mean device: thepublication of Dr. Janes\u2019s letter of the same date was delayedtill 6 March, the date that it bore, viz., 24 February, being alsofalsified, as we have said above, and changed to 3 March! Theadvantage, though temporary, that was obtained by this trickwas that a few days before this, viz., on 25 February, Swamijihad denied, in reply to a leading question put to him at the endof a lecture he delivered that day at the Pouch Mansion (asreported in the Standard Union) that the life of all Hindu widowswas one of misery, they being protected by law. Read on 6March as a statement made on 3 March, Dr. Janes\u2019s denial (ina statement made by him on 24 February) that Swamiji hadmade a statement to that effect thus appeared to be palpablyfalse, \u2014 that is, in view of what Swamiji had said on 25February.SWAMIJI AND THE RAMABAI LADIES OF BROOKLYNSWAMI VIVEKANANDA944Of course, Dr. Janes protested to the paper, in his letterto it on 12 March, against the \u201cerroneous date\u201d appended tohis letter of 24 February, but they did not print his letter till 17March, when, with another statement from Mrs. McKeen on10 March, the issue between her and Swamiji had been squarelyjoined, and Dr. Janes\u2019s particular contention did not seem tobe very important matter. Mrs. McKeen, who had been cleverenough to avoid mentioning Swamiji by name in her firststatement, could now (in her statement of 10 March) not onlymention him by name but charge him with having held theviews that she had challenged in her earlier statement. Shesought to strengthen her position in this regard by saying furthernot only that she had heard from reliable persons that Swamijihad made the statement attributed to him, but that one of theirown national board had \u201cheard him so declare at a meeting ofa well-known Boston literary club\u201d. (So, we may remarkincidentally, the cat was out of the bag: Swamiji had been theirb\u00eate noire since he had spoken before them at Boston on 21August 1893 and they were quitting scores with him.)We do not know whether the great papers of New York,such as the New York Tribune, cared to cover Swamiji\u2019sengagements of this period at Brooklyn, and if they did so,what position they took in respect of this controversy. The NewYork Tribune, as we have said above, had reported Swamiji\u2019sfirst lecture before the Ethical Association on 30 December,and we have reproduced in part the Rutherford American\u2019sversion of it. The likelihood is that these papers passed overthe agitation raised by the Ramabai Circle as little more than amissionary squabble. They did not give coverage even to themore important events of Swamiji\u2019s stay at New York at thistime, viz., and his Vedanta classes, which had begun in the lastweek of January. (As we learn from a letter of Swamiji to Mr.945E. T. Sturdy in January 1896 they began to consider them as ofsufficient importance at about that time only.) The controversywas thus left to be carried on in the columns of the Brooklynpapers such as the Daily Eagle and the Standard Union which,in handling the controversy, were, to say the least, unfair toSwamiji. The former was possibly working as may haveappeared to our readers already from what we have said aboutits conduct in some matters, in collusion with the Ramabailadies and the missionaries, who may surely be stronglysuspected of being at the back of the whole affair.We are disinclined to give more space to the matter, butcertain facts must be stated, for example that, besides falsifyingthe date of Dr. Janes\u2019s letter, these papers were guilty of otherunfair practices. To give one instance, the account given bythe Standard Union of the replies given by Swamiji to questionsput to him at the end of his lecture on 25 February, especiallyto the leading one on Indian widows, was incomplete, with theresult that the Ramabai ladies took undue advantage from it.The Daily Eagle also did the same, as Dr. Janes pointed out inhis letter to them dated 12 March. Said Dr. Janes in this letter,\u201cAnd on behalf of the Swami Vivekananda I will add that thereport of the remarks in the Eagle was both imperfect anddefective. While he repudiated the unfair and extravagantstatements about the treatment of Hindu widows he alsodeclared himself in full sympathy with the movement in favourof their education, as conducted by his friend and compatriot,Sasipada Banerjee\u201d. While he had denied that Hindu widowswere ill-treated, he had, as Swamiji himself pointed out later,admitted that some cases of ill-treatment might exist \u2014 thesebeing sporadic and exceptional. He had repudiated positivelyand without qualification the statement that illtreatment ofwidows was an accepted and traditional part of Hindu custom,SWAMIJI AND THE RAMABAI LADIES OF BROOKLYNSWAMI VIVEKANANDA946restating, as had appeared in the Standard Union report referredto above, the pertinent inheritance laws.The controversy should have ended here, both sideshaving stated and restated their positions, the merits and defectsof which had now become quite clear to all. It was neverthelessdragged on, either because some of the newspapers were biasedin favour of the Ramabai Circle, or, as it appears, were actingin collusion with them, or because they simply kept it alive forthe mere delight of it. The net result was not further clarification,but further confusion, which benefited one of the parties, viz.,the ladies, since it was in the power of the papers to close thecontroversy when they chose to do so, and they did it when theladies seemed to have had the best of the encounter. However,to proceed with our narrative of the events, Mrs. McKeenreplied, in a letter published on 10 March in the Daily Eagle,to Dr. Janes\u2019s contentions in his letter to that paper of 24February, which had, as we have seen, been published on 6March after its date had been fraudulently altered to 3 March.She easily disposed of Dr. Janes\u2019s contention that Swamiji hadnot denied in his speech on 20 January 1895 that high casteHindu widows underwent suffering by referring to Swamiji\u2019sstatement on the subject in reply to a question put to him at theend of his lecture on 25 February. (As we have seen, the paperhad given her the opportunity to do so by falsifying the date ofDr. Janes\u2019s letter and publishing it after Swamiji had made astatement on 25 February. It would even seem that the questionswere put to Swamiji at this meeting of 25 February in theinterests of the paper.) With reference to Dr. Janes\u2019s contentionthat it was not  the object aimed at by Pandita Ramabai but hermethods of collecting money for it that were questionable andhis allusions to Babu Sasipada Banerjee as affording a contrast,Mrs. McKeen had ready answers. As to the former she said947that it was Ramabai\u2019s contention that the Hindus themselveswere transgressing the old laws, and that, like Luther atWittenberg, she was appealing to the scriptures against the lawof the Church. She pointed out that Ramabai had persistentlydeclared that the high caste Brahmin could be reached only bya nonreligious school, and that she could accept aid only fromgood men and women of all denominations. As regards BabuSasipada Banerjee, Mrs. McKeen said that she had now at handa letter received from him explaining to her association hiswork and asking for sympathy and aid.Mrs. McKeen, however, spoilt what might appear as agood case by making certain wild statements with a view furtherto bolstering it up. She mentioned a certain Mr. Moncure D.Conway as having narrated to her an experience of his whichthat good gentleman recently had \u2014 of all places in the world\u2014 in Persia, which was a Muslim land with no Hinduinhabitants. He had seen with his own eyes there (in Persia!)the young men fairly gnashing their teeth in rage, while tearsrolled down their cheeks, and exclaiming. \u201cTo think that ourRamabai, our brilliant Ramabai, of whom we were so proud,to think that she had embraced Christianity!\u201d And so, like theseyoung men of Persia, Mrs. McKeen insinuated, Swamiji, outof religious intolerance, resented Ramabai\u2019s conversion, andthis resentment was at the back of his criticism of Ramabai.She made light of Dr. Janes\u2019s statement about the resignationsof the Hindu members of the advisory board of Ramabai\u2019sschool by informing all concerned that many of them hadrepented of their hasty move and some had taken pains toexpress publicly their renewed confidence. She ended her letterwith high praise for Ramabai, emphasizing her loyalty to herpeople.SWAMIJI AND THE RAMABAI LADIES OF BROOKLYNSWAMI VIVEKANANDA948In his reply to Mrs. McKeen, dated 12 March, whichwas published in the Daily Eagle on 17 March, Dr. Janes hadlittle difficulty about exposing the absurdity of the Conwaystory. He restated his view that Hindus had repugnance for theministrations of Christian converts, and remarked that if themost Christian lady in Brooklyn avowed her belief in Buddhismor Mohammedanism, she would no more be acceptable as areformer of society in America than Pandita Ramabai was inIndia. While paying a tribute to the Pandita\u2019s sincerity anddevotion, he deprecated the attack that had been made onSwami Vivekananda, in the name of Ramabai, which, he said,\u201cthat loyal woman would never have made herself\u201d. He resentedthe inference that had been drawn that Swamiji was opposedto the education of Hindu women, and said that he expected todispose of it soon, and effectually, by a lecture which, heannounced, Swamiji would deliver in aid of the educationalwork of Babu Sasipada Banerjee, so warmly commended byMrs. McKeen. (Swamiji\u2019s last lecture at Brooklyn, entitled\u201cSome Customs of the Hindus: What They Mean and HowThey as Misinterpreted\u201d was delivered at the Pouch Galleryon 7 April in aid of Babu Sasipada Banerjee\u2019s school.)112Such a happy termination of the controversy was,however, a prospect that was too intolerable for Mrs. McKeento envisage. Swamiji had made some statements, viz., thatHindu widows in general were not ill-treated, being protectedby law, and that though there might be isolated cases of theirilltreatment that was not because of the teachings of Hinduism,which, she felt, spelt danger to everything that she and hercompatriots stood for. She entered the lists again by grantingan interview to a representative of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle,an account of which was published in that paper on 6 April,1895.113 Mrs. McKeen challenged Swamiji\u2019s statements on949Hindu law respecting the inheritance of property by Hinduwomen and categorically maintained that Hindu widows hadno rights of inheritance at all, quoting Manu for her purpose.She pointed out that Babu Sasipada Banerjee was as much aheretic and outlaw to the orthodox Hindu as Ramabai herselfand that he solicited foreign help as much as the latter. She,however, largely spoiled her case by getting hysterical as sheproceeded with her attacks on Swamiji which reached theirclimax when she declared that Swamiji had paralysed thePresident of the Ethical Association (Dr. Janes) by means ofhypnotism so that he could be betrayed from the path ofcommon sense!! She concluded her statement with repeatingthe Unity and the Minister\u2019s mischievous allegation thatSwamiji was better known as an actor on the Naba Brindabanstage than as a philosopher and repeating some other chargesagainst Swamiji which were leveled against him by themissionaries, viz., that his philosophy was derived fromChristian sources and was rejected by orthodox Hindus. (Itappears from a letter of Swamiji to Alasinga, dated July, 1895,that the Christian missionaries of India had a pamphletpublished on the controversy between the ladies and Dr. Janes,which reached America early enough to provide Mrs. McKeenwith their allegations against Swamiji).114To this outburst Dr. Janes prepared a full reply, withquotations from Manu and authorities on Hindu law which, heclaimed, completely disposed of the legal questions raised byhis critics. As we learn from a letter from Mrs. Bull to MaryHale, dated 16 April 1895115, he did not expect the Daily Eagleto publish it, since it was rather lengthy, and he proposed tobring it before the American people in some way. We have,however, no definite information that he did so, or as to howhe did so, and so far as the controversy in the press wasconcerned, Mrs. McKeen had the last word, it being closed bySWAMIJI AND THE RAMABAI LADIES OF BROOKLYNSWAMI VIVEKANANDA950the Daily Eagle with her last letter, and she apparently emergedvictorious out of it.116Before we leave this episode of Swamiji\u2019s life that isassociated with Brooklyn, we owe it to our readers to givethem some details of his last two lectures at the place, to whichwe have referred above. His lecture on \u201cIndia\u2019s Gift to theWorld\u201d was delivered on 25 February 1895 at the hall of theLong Island Historical Society before a fairly large audience.In an age when the intellectual elite of his own country weremostly blind to their great cultural heritage and sang hallelujahsto the West, and before an audience, which must have containedmany students of History, Swamiji spoke of the greatcontributions that his ancestors has made to all branches ofhuman knowledge. One really wonders at the wide range ofhis studies on the subject of his lecture \u2014 much of which, weare afraid, is little known to the average student of Indian historyeven at the present day. He spoke about the debt of Christianityto Buddhism, and referred to Asoka\u2019s treaties with Greekprinces in whose dominions his missionaries has disseminatedBuddha\u2019s teachings. He spoke about India\u2019s contributions tomedicine and surgery, specially mentioning the mending ofmisshapen ears and noses, the science of which, by the way, isbeing developed only in our own time under the name of plasticsurgery. He reminded his audience that the ten numerals, thevery cornerstone of all present civilizations, were discoveredin India. In philosophy, of course, Indians were head andshoulders above all nations as, he said, Schopenhauer hadacknowledged. He said that the Sanskrit language was thefoundation of all European languages, which he described as\u201cbut jargonized Sanskrit\u201d. He mentioned Kalidasa\u2019s immortaldrama, \u201cAbhijnana Sakuntala\u201d, which Goethe had summarizedas \u201cheaven and earth united\u201d, and said that the fables of Aesop951had been copied by Aesop from an old Sanskrit work. Inmanufacture, said he, India was the first to make cotton andpurple dye, was proficient in the art of jewelry, and the veryword `sugar\u2019 as well as the article itself, and was the productof India. India also invented the game of chess, he said.What has the world given to India in return for what itreceived? asked Swamiji. He himself provided the answer, ifonly to draw from it a lofty moral. India had received backfrom the world nothing but vilification and curse and contempt.\u201cThe world waded in the lifeblood of her children, reducedthem to poverty and slavery, and now it added insult to injuryby preaching to her a religion which can only thrive on thedestruction of every other religion. India, however, Swamijideclared, was not afraid: she could not fight to conquer but shetrusted in the eternity of truth. India\u2019s message to the worldwas, first of all, her blessing; she was returning good for eviland thus putting into execution the noble idea that originatedwith her. Lastly, her message was that calm, goodness, patienceand gentleness will ultimately triumph. \u201cFor,\u201d Said he, \u201cwhereare the Greeks, the onetime masters of the earth? Where arethe Romans, at the tramp of whose cohorts the world trembled?Passed away. Where are the Arabs, who in fifty years had carriedtheir banners from the Atlantic to the Pacific? And where arethe Spaniards, the cruel murderers of millions of men? Bothraces are nearly extinct; but thanks to the morality of herchildren, the kinder race will never perish, and she will yet seethe hour of their triumph\u201d.In a lecture delivered at Pasadena (California) duringhis second visit to America, entitled \u201cThe Women of India\u201d,Swamiji repeated the above peroration, and added a few morewords. We do not know if at the lecture at Brooklyn he did theSWAMIJI AND THE RAMABAI LADIES OF BROOKLYNSWAMI VIVEKANANDA952same \u2014 they are not to be found in the report of it published inthe Standard Union of 27 February, quoted from above. But asthey come in the train of the thoughts of this lecture, we arereproducing them here. \u201cThe Hindu has learned his lesson. Hedoes not want to prattle like the babies of today. . . . She hasturned her face towards Him ... She has made many mistakes;loads and loads of rubbish there are in India. Never mind\u2014what of that? What is the clearing of rubbish, the cleaning ofcities, and all that? Does that give life? Those that have fineinstitutions, they too die. And what of institutions, those tinplateWestern institutions, made in five days and broken on the sixth?One of these little handful nations cannot keep alive for twocenturies together. And our institutions have stood the test ofages. Says the Hindu, `Behold, our ideal is the Spirit. Thatalone exists and, like Him, we live forever\u2019.\u201d117Swamiji\u2019s last lecture at Brooklyn, delivered on 7 Aprilat the Pouch Gallery was as much a \u201cparting shot\u201d as had beenhis lecture of 21 February 1894 with which he had ended hisseries of lectures at Detroit during his first visit there. Like hislecture at Detroit too on 11 March 1894, it was a \u201cfinishingblow\u201d to his opponents, with the difference that though it was\u201chis answering lecture,\u201d he made no attempt in his lecture toexplain to his critics what, on account of their blind prejudice,was beyond them to understand, viz., the true position of Indianwidows. His lecture, entitled \u201cSome Customs of the Hindus:What They Mean and How they are Misinterpreted\u201d, did notcontain the slightest reference to that particular subject, and ifit was a reply to critics, it was done by complete silence onthem, or ignoring them altogether. On the other hand, he gavehis listeners a general idea of India, and his views on somecustoms, like caste, which Westerners found hard to understand.He severely criticized the foreign writers on things Indian who,with brains \u201caddled by superstition\u201d thought that all those who953were outside the pale of their own religion were horribleblackguards. He said that each nation must work out its ownsalvation and that no one else could solve its problems. Hepleaded that India be let alone. He did so, it would seem,successfully for, after this lectures was delivered, few voiceswere heard criticizing him, personally or otherwise.The lecture was reported in the Standard Union and theDaily Eagle of 8 April, both papers making up for their pastlapses by giving what would seem to be accurate, though brief,reports. Swamiji spoke with great earnestness \u2014 his eyes brightand a flush mantling his face, as the Standard Union reported.He began the lecture with an account of the general conditionof Indians. His discourse on the caste system, which followed,was very comprehensive and quite intelligible to his listenersas he explained that it was a trade guild (an institution metwith in mediaeval Europe) and not a religious institution. Hedwelt on the evils of the system, but deprecated the attempts ofthe reformers to abolish it altogether. \u201cHe said that to abolishcaste one must change the social conditions completely anddestroy the entire economic system of the country. Better, hesaid that the waves of the Bay of Bengal flow and drown allrather than this\u201d. He gave the English a good raking over andsaid they used three B\u2019s to \u201ccivilize\u201d India \u2014 Bible, brandyand bayonet. He decried the foreign educated Hindus, anddescribed their return to their native land \u201cfull of champagneand new ideas\u201d. He denounced child marriages.As has been said above, Swamiji strongly deprecatedforeigners writing on the social and religious customs of India.They got their ideas, said he, from the Pariahs, who were a sortof human scavengers, because they had no access to the homesof high caste Hindus. The speech, as we have said above,  wasSWAMIJI AND THE RAMABAI LADIES OF BROOKLYNSWAMI VIVEKANANDA954a plea for letting India alone, and whether it was as a directeffect of it or not, the American papers henceforth did leavehim alone. From this time, and, indeed, till the end of his stayin America public opposition to him ceased, or abatedconsiderably. This may have been due to the fact that thoughin this lecture he said nothing about Indian widows, he had, byexplaining in general the significance of India\u2019s customs, placedthis specific problem in a new light and thus enlightenedRamabai\u2019s supporters. Mrs. Burke, however, thinks that suchdetermined opponents as these could not have been silencedby reasoning alone. She believes that Swamiji silenced them\u201cby a thunderbolt of awesome power\u201d as he had \u201cmysteriouslysilenced the cavillings of the Christian missionaries\u201d at Detroit.Be that as it may, there were other factors that operated to thesame end. As we have seen above, Dr. Janes had prepared a\u201cfull reply\u201d to Mrs. McKeen, and failing to get it published inthe Daily Eagle, must have done something (as he had said hewould do) to place it before the American public. Thenewspapers also had had enough of the matter, and theirreporters must have thought of seeking fresh fields and pasturesnew. In a letter to G. G. dated 11 January 1895, Swamiji saidthat these who were trying to harm him had exhaustedthemselves, and left off.118The Ramabai ladies had cried themselves hoarse aboutthe Indian widows, but they far from left Swamiji alone. As wehave seen above, they began a whispering campaign againstSwamiji, and either themselves invented scandals about him,or joined hands with other scandalmongers and gavecountrywide circulation to them. Swamiji was hurt at hisopponents taking resort to these mean tactics for fighting him,as we learn from his letter to Mrs. Bull, 21 March 1895, quotedearlier. We have read, however, how Mrs. Bagley boldly stepped955forward in his defence, and gave the lie to the rumours byproducing facts  and reiterating her faith in him. Other friendswere active, as we know from two letters of Swamiji to Alasingadated 6 May 1895 and 9 September 1895.119 (The relevantpassages are unaccountably omitted in the original versions ofthese letters published in the Complete Works.) From the firstletter we learn that at this time Dr. William James entered thelists against \u201cthe Christian lady named Ramabai\u201d and deliveredsome hard blows. We learn from the other letter that Dr. Janesput the scandalmongers completely to rout by challenging themto produce facts, or else be proved to be liars. If you have seenSwamiji committing a misdeed, said he, come forward, say so,and produce evidence; if you have not personally seen anythingbut have only heard others saying that they saw some things,name them, and ask them to prove their accusations. It goeswithout saying that, thus challenged, the scandalmongers tookto their heels, and hid themselves in the dark \u2014 where theybelonged.Like the sun coming out of the clouds which could donothing to affect its own light and glory, Swamiji now shonemore brightly than ever and commenced a new career \u2014imparting the light of Vedanta to many earnest souls who wereattracted to his classes in New York. To that story we turn inthe next Chapter.NOTES AND REFERENCES1 C.W., cited, VIII, 301.2 Vani O Rachana, cited, VII, 28.3 C.W., cited, VII, 461-62.SWAMIJI AND THE RAMABAI LADIES OF BROOKLYNSWAMI VIVEKANANDA9569574 Ibid., 463.5 C.W., cited, V, 39.6 Ibid., 44.7 C.W., cited, VI, 295-96.8 Ibid., 340.9 Prabuddha Bharata, January, 1934.10 Dr. Barrows, The World\u2019s Parliament of Religions, Vol. II, cited,                1075.11 C .W., cited, VII, 463.12 The Life, cited, II, 440.13 The Life, cited, 340.14 C .W., cited, VII, 468-69.15 Ibid., 460.16 Ghatanabali, cited, III, 110-16.17 Vani O Rachana, cited, VI, 410.

We have a fuller account of Swamiji\u2019s activities from5 to 29 December from a letter written by Mrs. Ole Bull to Dr. Lewis G.Janes on 27 December 1895. The relevant portion of this letter reads asfollows: \u201cWe had him with us three weeks and he has given two lessonsdaily and three formal talks. The lessons heard included the eightUpanishads, several renderings from the Gita and the Sankhya books ofRealisation. The interest awakened has been very unusual and the effect isto be deep and permanent with many . . . Roman Catholics, Swedenborgiansand Episcopalians all paid him the tribute of expressing their best thought,and he has helped students who were bewildered by their course ofphilosophy at Harvard. We have had a Greenacre annexe. Seven lectureswith classes. The Greenacre spirit prevailed.Mr. Vivekananda as a guest and friend has endeared himself to all.He is so very human and so much of a boy with it all.(The Life 5th edn,7, 514-515)79 C.W., cited, VIII, 332.SWAMI VIVEKANANDA96080 Ibid.81 Ibid., 333.82 Ibid., It may be noted that in C.W., cited, VIII, 333, there isfound (immediately after this letter) a letter purported to be written on 10February 1895. As internal evidence clearly indicates, the date is wrong.The correct date should be sometime in the early part of 1896 (See NewDiscoveries, cited, 482-83)83 The Life., cited, 408.84 C.W., cited, V, 49.85 Vani O Rachana, cited, VII, 52.86 C.W., cited, V, 16.87 Ibid., 27.88 C.W., cited, VIII, 302.89 C.W., cited, V, 44.90 Ibid., 34.91 C.W., cited, VII, 472.92 C.W., cited, V, 67.93 Ibid., 65.94 Ibid., 62.95 Ibid., 47.96 Ibid., 91.97 Ibid., 10.98 Ibid., 29.99 C.W., cited, VI, 255.100 C.W., cited, V, 35.101 C.W., cited, VI, 281.102 Ibid., 265.103 C.W., cited, VIII, 318-19.104 New Discoveries, cited, 467.105 C.W., cited, I, 329-32.106 C.W., cited, V, 312-14. The Publishers of C.W., state that thediscussion took place \u201cat the Brooklyn Ethical Society\u201d, but do not mentionthe date when or the lecture at the end of which it took place. It seems to us961that this section contains a collection of some questions and answers ofseveral days.Swamiji\u2019s reply to the question whether Hinduism was aproselytizing religion, viz., \u201cI have a message to the West as Buddha had amessage to the East\u201d, does not seem to have been made on this day. We donot really know when or where this great pronouncement was made bySwamiji. The Publishers vaguely tell us that \u201cwhen\u201d Swamiji was askedthis question \u201cin America\u201d, he replied like that.107 New Discoveries, cited, 480-82.108 Ibid., 490.109 Ibid., 489.110 Ibid., 482. It may be noted in this connection that a letterpurported to be written by Swamiji to Mrs. Bull on Saturday, 24 January1895 is found in C.W., VI, 289_300. The date, as the internal evidence ofthe letter shows, was actually Saturday, 25 January 1896. Without thiscorrection, the reader may fall into the error of thinking that Swamiji wasdelivering lectures in New York almost every Sunday throughout the firsttwo months of 1895. He did so in 1896. (See New Discoveries, cited,482_84).111 Ibid., 491-93.112 It may be mentioned in this connection that Sasipada Babu\u2019sinstitution at Baranagore was much older than Ramabai\u2019s institution atPoona and that it was here that Ramabai herself obtained the first inspirationfor her work (Indian Newspapers, cited, 458, 635).113 New Discoveries, cited, 519-23.114 Vani O Rachana, cited, VII, 132.115 New Discoveries, cited, 524.116 Though the Daily Eagle closed the controversy at this stageand, so far as our information goes, let Swamiji alone, the Standard Uniondid not do so. It raked up the whole affair about six years later when, in itsnotice of the Brooklyn Ramabai Circle, it made a renewed attack on Swamijifor statements he had allegedly made in the lectures before the BrooklynEthical Association in 1895. Against this, in a letter to the paper dated 21March 1901, the indefatigable Dr. Lewis G. Janes vigorously protested. InSWAMI VIVEKANANDA962this letter, besides defending Swamiji, Dr. Janes made noble complimentto Indian women, citing, inter alia, the testimony of Mrs. Ole Bull who,said he, had recently spent a year in India (Indian Newspapers, cited,634_35).117 C.W., VIII, 71-72.118 Vani O Rachana, cited, VII, 65.119 Ibid., 115, 153.963New York, 1895"

The immediate occasion was tokeep an engagement with the Ethical Association of Brooklynto deliver a lecture under their auspices at the city on 30December. Actually he had come to arrange for holding classeson Vedanta at New York in accordance with a change in theplan of his work in America that was, as we have seen, maturingfor a pretty long time. He had been feeling that rovingcontinuously from city to city for delivering public lectureswas exhausting him physically and mentally and that though ithad brought him much public appreciation, the attempt therebyto raise money was thoroughly uncongenial and debasing tohim. 1 The new plan was to settle down at a suitable place andto initiate a few selected pupils in the doctrine and practice ofVedanta, so that they might take up the task of spreading hismessage in America. He wrote to Mr. E. T. Sturdy about thison 24 April 1895, \u201cI did a good deal of platform work in thecountry last year, and received plenty of applause, but foundthat I was only working for myself. . . . So this year I am hopingto work along this line in training up to practical Advaitarealisation a small band of men and women\u201d. 2 Already in thesummer he had given a trial to this method at Greenacre andduring his stay with Mrs. Bull in October held some classes inher parlour, which were attended by the latter\u2019s intellectual965friends, including probably Dr. William James, before whomhe had given a demonstration of samadhi. For reasons that wehave discussed in the preceding Chapter, he had selected NewYork as the proper place where he might try out his new plan.In November 1894, as we have seen, Swamiji had founded asociety in New York, the purpose of which is not quite clear tous but which was perhaps a step in the direction of theimplementation of his new plan. As we learn from his letter toMrs. Bull from Chicago dated 3 January 1895, 3 where he haddropped in to spend the New Year\u2019s day with the Hale family,his \u201cNew York course\u201d was by the time \u201cnearly ready\u201d, and hewas expecting his friend, Miss Phillips, to arrange it incooperation with another friend, Miss Thursby.At this moment, however, an unfortunate event happenedwhich upset the arrangements which were being made by hisfriends and seems to have forced Swamiji to start hisorganization on a new basis. As we learn from a letter fromSwamiji to Mary Hale dated 1 February 1895, one day (probablyin early January 1895) when Swamiji happened to be on a visitto the house of Miss Thursby, presumably in connection withthe arrangements for the New York classes of his, he was sharplycriticized by a Presbyterian gentleman who also happened tobe a visitor at the house at that time. It seems that for onceSwamiji forgot to observe his self-imposed rule of maintainingsilence, or caution in self-defense and had an \u201cexcitedargument\u201d with his opponent who, says Swamiji, \u201cas usual,got very hot, angry, and abusive\u201d. 4 Our readers must be awarethat many times during his stay in the West, Swamiji had toput up with insults hurled at him by racial or religious fanatics.They may recall in particular that while he was attending abanquet that was given in his honour at her own residence byMrs. Bagley a similar incident had happened. On that occasionIN GOD\u2019S HANDSSWAMI VIVEKANANDA966Swamiji had refused to utter a word in reply to the hystericaloutburst of his lady accuser, and his exemplary forbearancehad been much appreciated by his friends. This time his reactionwas different. The fact could not simply be ascribed to amomentary loss of temper (to which he was sometimes prone),as we shall presently find.One would have liked to draw a veil over this unpleasantincident, as some well-known biographers have done, but it ishardly possible in an objective presentation of Swamiji\u2019s lifeto pass over it, since also it definitely seems to have producedimportant consequences. Some of Swamiji\u2019s best friends andadmirers seem to have been terribly shocked at his conductwhich they thought was inconsistent with his profession of lovefor all mankind, saints and sinners alike, and protested stronglyagainst it. Miss Thursby seems to have altogether withdrawn,at least for some time, from the work in connection with thearrangements for the Vedanta classes which, as we shallpresently see, now fell on other shoulders. In any case, we donot hear about her as continuing to play the leading role thatshe had assumed some time back. We, however, learn from aletter from Swamiji to Mrs. Bull dated 7 May 1895 that, afterthe classes had started, she frequently attended them, as didsome others like Mrs. Hamlin, who had held aloof for sometime and about whom Swamiji wrote a very feeling letter alsoto Mrs. Bull on 11 April 1895.Even Mrs. Bull reprimanded him severely, to use thewords of Swamiji himself on the subject and it did not soothehis feelings anymore because the rebuke was not for hisbehaviour but for the adverse effects it was likely to have onhis prospects in New York. As we shall see, he disliked thesuggestion made to him by his wealthy friends that he should967learn to get on with the world if he wanted success in his workand such a one from Mrs. Bull must have pained him deeply.We learn from his letter to her dated 14 February 1895 that herefused to receive a gift of books by her on the plea that he wasconstantly roving about and it was inconvenient for him tocarry the burden with him constantly. In the same letter hedeclined a monetary contribution by her to his plan of work inIndia and suggested that the money might better be given toMiss Farmer for her Greenacre work. \u201cIndia can wait\u201d, wrotehe, \u201cas she is waiting for centuries and an immediate work inhand should always have the preference\u201d. As we have seen,Swamiji had been chafing for some time past at the restraintssought to be imposed on him by his wealthy friends in returnfor the help that they gave him, viz., that he should say the\u201cright\u201d things and mix among the \u201cright\u201d people only. In thelight of this one feels that the pleas on which he declinedMrs. Bull\u2019s proffered help were not all that agitated his mindat the time. His ruffled feelings were indeed ill-concealed in afew more words that he wrote to Mrs. Bull in this letter inexplanation of his refusal. He said, \u201cAgain, according to Manu,collecting funds even for a good work is not good for aSannyasin and I have begun to feel that the old sages wereright. `Hope is the greatest misery, despair is the greatesthappiness\u2019. It appears like a hallucination. I am getting out ofthem. I was in these childish ideas of doing this and doingthat\u201d. 5If his relations with Mrs. Bull had been somewhatstrained, even though only for a brief while, on account of thisincident, they were quickly restored, her strong affection forand devotion to him making her forget it soon. With Mrs. Hale,however, the case was a little different, as the exchange ofcorrespondence between them on the subject, of which,IN GOD\u2019S HANDSSWAMI VIVEKANANDA968however, only one letter, viz., Mrs. Hale\u2019s to him, dated 20February 1895, is before us, would indicate. This letter is to befound in the first edition of Mrs. Burke\u2019s work and thoughdiscarded in the second edition on the ground that its date isuncertain, was undoubtedly written in this context. The relevantportion deserves to be quoted in full. Wrote she, \u201cMy dearSwami: I did not intend answering your first letter. I thoughtbest to let the matter drop and have no more words on thesubject but now that the second one has come, beginning withthe same story, full of the same spirit, not of love but of hate \u2014 of revilings, of bitterness and of rancour, I cannot but expressmyself \u2014 I confess, dear Brother, to a feeling of terribledisappointment \u2014 a year ago such a letter from your pen wouldhave been an utter impossibility. I am glad to have that time tolook back upon! Where is the great and radiant soul that cameto the Parliament of Religions, so full of love of God that hisface shone with Divine light, whose words were fire, whosevery presence created an atmosphere of harmony and purity,thereby drawing all souls to himself? It is now our turn to cry`My\u2019!! Where now is your illustration of the light in the lamp?The force of the Lord reflected in all his creation? You are afunny child \u2014\u201d. To dilute the acerbity of her accusations, shethen wrote a few words about Harriet McKindley, Father Pope,etc., and then again said, \u201cI am not going to apologize for thislong letter and I do hope you will shed a ray of light on a few ofmy perplexities.\u201d6Even though, as Mrs. Burke says, there is someuncertainty about the date of this letter, one may hazard theguess that it was written after Swamiji\u2019s letter to Mary dated 1February 1895, which may indeed be taken to be the secondletter of Swamiji that Mrs. Hale alluded to in her letter quotedfrom above. Swamiji\u2019s letter to Mary was written in reply to a969letter to him by her, which is not available to us but which, asSwamiji\u2019s reply indicates, was in connection with the incidentat Miss Thursby\u2019s house. In her letter, we may guess, she hadexpressed her sisterly concern at the unhappy affair, and shehad given him some good advice, which she may have thoughtit was her sisterly privilege to tender. Swamiji thanked Maryfor her \u201cbeautiful letter\u201d, and went on to make his position inthe matter and in all such matters generally, perfectly clear toher. Mary did not take it amiss and, indeed, as we have statedin a previous Chapter, engaged herself, shortly afterwards, incarrying on a rhymed correspondence with him on a highlyphilosophical subject. Mrs. Hale\u2019s reaction to Swamiji\u2019s letterto Mary was expectedly different \u2014 Swamiji knew that shewas an orthodox Christian 7 \u2014 and it is probable that the milddisapproval that he expressed in his letter to Alasinga dated 12January 1895 8, when the latter sent a copy of the Reply to theMadras Address to a certain lady, whose name is understandablynot given in the reproduction of the letter in Vani O Rachana,9 related to her. Wrote Swamiji, \u201cYou did not do well in sendinga copy of the Reply to the Madras Address to Mrs. \u2014. She isan orthodox Christian; hence the criticism that I have made init of the orthodox people will be unpalatable to her. However,all\u2019s well that ends well\u201d. (Unaccountably, the relevant portionis omitted altogether in the reproduction of the letter in C.W.)10 It may be mentioned incidentally here that even Mary Haledid not like his Reply to the Madras Address. In a letter to herdated 26 June 1895 from Thousand Island Park, Swamiji wrote,\u201cYou fussed so much over my reply to Madras but it hasproduced tremendous effect there\u201d. 11Swamiji\u2019s letter to Mary is one of the finest he ever wrote.He stated his position firmly and frankly, yet taking the greatestcare not to wound susceptibilities, and softening the hardestIN GOD\u2019S HANDSSWAMI VIVEKANANDA970statements with expressions of brotherly love. In an earlierChapter we have quoted some lines of this letter, but a closerattention to the ideas he expressed therein is called for in ourpresent context, viz., and his plan for opening Vedanta classesin New York. The letter throws a light on Swamiji\u2019s reactionnot only to the  outburst of the Presbyterian gentleman atMiss Thursby\u2019s house but to the attitude of his friends, someof whom had offered to help him about the arrangements forthe forthcoming Vedanta classes and were actually busy doingso. In our opinion, the incident and the attitude of his wealthyfriends acted as the proverbial last straw for Swamiji, andinduced him once and for all to throw off the restraints imposedupon him by his association with these friends. To make ourmeaning quite clear, they had an important effect on the planfor organization of the Vedanta classes.Swamiji told Mary that he knew fully well how good itwas for one\u2019s worldly prospects to be sweet, and that he dideverything to be sweet to everybody, but that when it came toa horrible compromise with the truth within, he stopped. Anordinary man, said he, may find his duty lying in obeying thecommands of his \u201cGod\u201d, society, but not so the children oflight. He could not accommodate himself to falsehood; the Lordwould not allow him to be a hypocrite. \u201cGod of Truth, Thoualone be my guide. I am too old to change now into milk andhoney\u201d, he declared. \u201cI have no desire for wealth, or name, orfame, or enjoyments, Sister \u2014 they are dust unto me. . . .I havenot the tact to earn money. . . The mind is still weak, Sister, itsometimes clutches at earthly help. But I am not afraid,\u201d headded. He referred to his quarrel with the Presbyterian priestand his long fight afterwards with Mrs. Bull, and stated clearlythe lesson he had drawn from them. They showed him, saidhe, if only in a clearer light, what Manu says to the Sannyasin,971\u201cLive alone, walk alone\u201d. In particular, they showed to himthe limitations of love and friendship, said he. \u201cThere neverwas a friendship, specially of women,\u201d he went on to say,\u201cwhich was not exacting\u201d. This was clearly in reference to therestraints imposed on him by his wealthy women friends, whichhe was long tired of, and which, as we shall presently see, heshook off now.A chapter of his life in America was over, and he wasdetermined to turn over a new leaf. He stated clearly what heintended to do henceforth and how he would do it. \u201cYou aremistaken, utterly mistaken if you think I have a work, asMrs. Bull thinks: I have no work under the sun. I have amessage, and I will give it after my own fashion. I will neitherHinduise my message, nor Christianise it, nor make it any `ise\u2019in the world. I will only myise it and that is all. Liberty, Mukti,is all my religion, and everything that tries to curb it, I willavoid by fight or flight. Pooh! I try to pacify the priests! Sister,do not take this amiss. But you are babies and babies mustsubmit to be taught.. If you cannot cheer those that dare dashthis false God, society, to the ground and trample on itsunmitigated hypocrisy; if you cannot cheer them, pray, be silent,but do not try to drag them down into the mire with such falsenonsense as compromise , and becoming nice and sweet\u201d. Thiswas a warning, we may think, not only to Mary but to all similarwell-wishers of his, like Mrs. Bull, Mrs. Hale, and others, tolet him, a Sannyasin, go his way. He went on to quoteBhartrihari. \u201cGo thou thy ways, Sannyasin! Some will say, `whois this mad man?\u2019 Others, `who is this Chandala?\u2019 Others willknow thee to be a sage. Be glad at the prattle of the wordlings!But when they attack, know that `the elephant passing throughthe marketplace is always beset by curs, but he cares not. Hegoes straight on his own way ! So it is always, when a greatIN GOD\u2019S HANDS"

The long letter ended with blessings for Mary, andthe prayer to God that \u201cHe may lead you quickly out of this bighumbug, the world\u201d. Soon afterwards, in a rhymedcorrespondence, he proclaimed his new resolve to Mary:\u201cThe wounded snake its hood unfurls,The flame stirred up doth blaze,The desert air resounds the callsOf hearts truck lion\u2019s rage.The cloud puts forth its deluge strengthWhen lightning cleaves its breast,When the soul is stirred to its inmost depthGreat Ones unfold their best.The beginning of the Vedanta classes in mean lodgings at54 West 33rd Street, New York on 28 or 29 January was theconcretization of Swamiji\u2019s new phase of his work in the Westthat had been foreshadowed for long. He was to give uplecturing before all and sundry \u2014 \u201dstrewing pearls before theswine\u201d \u2014 and was now to attempt to train up a few selectedmen and women in the manner of spiritual teachers in his owncountry. He wanted not only to impart to them divine knowledgebut initiate them in the practice of yoga. His \u201cright-hand man\u201din his new venture was not any of his wealthy friends, but aman as penniless as himself, Leon Landsberg, who appearedin our pages for the first time as having attended Swamiji\u2019slecture at New York on 2 May 1894. We shall say more later973about Swamiji\u2019s early association with this singular individual,who for a time now played an important part in the ordering ofSwamiji\u2019s affairs, and then left and rejoined him, went the sameround once again, and finally left, even betrayed, him.12 It washe who rented two rooms, one for himself and the other toserve as Swamiji\u2019s headquarters, as we learn from his letter toIsabelle McKindley dated 23 January 1895, at 54 West 33rdStreet, which they moved into on 27 January 1895. By the way,the rooms having been rented, as we learn from this letter, byLandsberg who,  though a Russian Jew, was a naturalizedAmerican citizen and, in any case, was not a coloured man.Sister Devamata\u2019s suggestion that Swamiji accepted inferiorquarter because of landladies, who had no racial prejudicespersonally, refusing to admit an Asiatic as boarder, or lodger,does not appear to be convincing, or as giving the whole story.(In his letter to Mary Hale, quoted above, Swamiji says that hewas \u201cliving with Landsberg\u201d.) Nor were Swamiji\u2019s financialdifficulties, which are usually considered as having dictatedhis choice of quarters, the primary cause. These considerationsarose because Swamiji, for reasons we have discussed at lengthabove, resolved to go his own way, and the acceptance by himof poor lodgings has to be explained by that fact.It was the first time now since Swamiji had left the shelterof the Baranagore Math about five years ago that he had aliving room where he could stay as long as he wished, or wherehe could dispose as he liked about himself, as to food, rest,work, recreation, etc. His newly found independence made himhappy and on 14 February he wrote to Mrs. Ole Bull, \u201cI amvery happy now. Between Landsberg and me, we cook somerice and lentils, or barley and quietly eat it, and write somethingor read, or receive visits from poor people who want to learnsomething, and thus I feel I am more of a Sannyasin now thanVEDANTA CLASSES IN NEW YORKSWAMI VIVEKANANDA974I ever was in America\u201d. 13 The blessedness of independent butpoor living was, however, not unmixed with acute discomforts,which told upon Swamiji\u2019s health. It put an unbearable strainon one of the partners, viz., Leon Landsberg who, for reasonsthat are not quite clear to us, left Swamiji to his fate not longafterwards, as we have said above, and was not heard of forsome time. The original idea perhaps was that one of the tworooms should belong to Landsberg and the other should serveas Swamiji\u2019s office \u2014 Swamiji himself to board and sleep atthe Guernseys. When Swamiji entered the lodgings on 27January, he was, as we learn from Landsberg\u2019s letter to IsabelleMcKindley referred to above, \u201cin good health and happy\u201d. Butwithin a few days he had a relapse of cold which had beenbrought on in the last week of January by his tramps back andforth between New York and Brooklyn over the frozen snowwith a keen north wind blowing all the while. Swamijiconsequently had to reside at their lodgings with Landsbergwith the result that the latter found himself overburdened withhousehold chores, besides having the heavy secretarial workthat he had elected to perform in connection with the lectureclasses.Swamiji insisted on giving his lessons \u201cfree as air\u201d to allwho came to his classes a la the heads of Indian institutions oflearning ( tols ), or the asramas or tapovanas of ancient times.He did his best to create \u201cthe atmosphere of a Himalayanasrama in the very heart of an American metropolis\u201d and theclasses not only expanded but were attended even by \u201cthe rightkind of people\u201d. As Swamiji wrote to Mrs. Bull on 11 April1895, though Miss Hamlin had thought that his living in poorquarters would \u201cend in nothing\u201d, and that \u201cno ladies wouldever come there\u201d, \u201cthe right kind\u201d came for all that, day andnight, and she too! \u201cWhere is the right kind, and where is the975bad, mother?\u201d Swamiji asked. \u201cIt is all He. In the tiger and inthe lamb, in the saint and the sinner, all He\u201d. 14 (As we shallsee later, the tigers also came and growled at the doors \u2014 the\u201coccultists\u201d, the materialists and others, who wanted to destroyhis work.) The classes did attract, as if they were one powerfulmagnet, some of the noblest of young American souls, \u2014 theMacLeod sisters, Miss Laura Glenn (later Sister Devamata),Miss S. E. Waldo (later Sister Haridasi) of Brooklyn, and manyothers.From some of them we have interesting accounts of theVedanta classes, the earliest among them being that ofMiss S. E. Waldo, which was first published in the PrabuddhaBharata in 1906. 15 Wrote Miss Waldo, \u201cHis earliest classeswere held in the small room that he occupied, and in thebeginning were attended by only three persons. They grew withastonishing rapidity, and as the little room filled to theoverflowing, became very picturesque. The Swami himselfalways sat on the floor, and most of his audience likewise. Themarble topped dresser, the arms of the sofa and even the cornerwashstand helped to furnish seats for the constantly increasingnumbers. The door was left open, and the overflow filled thehall and sat on the stairs. And those first classes! How intenselyinteresting they were! Who that was privileged to attend themcan ever forget them? The Swami so dignified yet so simple,so gravely earnest, so eloquent, and the close rank of students,forgetting all inconveniences, hanging breathless on his everyword!\u201dMiss Christine Greenstidel, who had attended Swamiji\u2019slectures in Detroit, was later to attend the classes at ThousandIsland Park, and still later to follow him in India and be knownas Sister Christine, was not present at the New York classes,VEDANTA CLASSES IN NEW YORKSWAMI VIVEKANANDA976but she gives us some more information about them.\u201cMillionaires were glad to sit on the floor,\u201d we read in hermemoirs, \u201cliterally at his feet. No charge was made for theteaching and often there was no money. Then Swamiji wouldgive a secular lecture for which he felt he could accept a fee.All that winter, he worked as he could. Often the last pennywas spent. It was a precarious way of carrying on the work andsometimes it seemed that it would come to an end\u201d. SisterChristine says that at this stage some of those with meansoffered to finance the undertaking but they made conditions(classes to be held in \u201cright place\u201d and only \u201cright people to beadmitted into them\u201d). Swamiji refused to make a compromisewith the conventional outlook  and worldly methods. (Actually,this had happened earlier, before the classes were opened atthis place.) Sister Christine says that after this a few earneststudents took the financial responsibility for the work, and therewas no further difficulty. (She seems to be incorrect here also.)We learn from Miss Waldo that Swamiji maintained the classesby the income he derived from giving some public lectureswhich, however, were not given in a hired hall, as stated by herbut, as he wrote to Mrs. Bull on 21 March 1895, 16 in his rooms(downstairs), which seated about a hundred persons.He gave also other public lectures, e.g., two lectures onVedanta philosophy, delivered under the auspices of Mrs. OleBull in the New York house of Mrs. A.L. Barbar, and henceknown as the Barbar House lectures and for which, as he wroteto Mrs. Bull on 25 April 1895, Miss Farmer sent him a chequefor a hundred dollars. 17 He also lectured before the DixonSociety and in May, perhaps also in April, gave public lecturesin the upper hall of the Mott\u2019s Memorial Buildings. Again,though \u201cthe parlour lectures\u201d which, according to Swamiji\u2019sletter to Mrs. Bull dated January, 1895 and Landsberg\u2019s letter977to Isabelle McKindley dated 23 January 1895, were to bearranged by Miss Thursby and Miss Farmer, did not take place,Swamiji did give some such lectures, as we learn from hisletter to Mrs. Bull dated 14 February 1895. From 17 February1895 to approximately 16 March 1895 he held classes on everySunday at the house of one Miss Corbin, discontinuing thembecause once again it was borne in on his mind that no greatwork could be done by the rich. 18 He also held a class, orclasses at the house of one Miss Andrews. 19Miss Laura Glenn (later Sister Devamata) has given afuller account of Swamiji\u2019s classes 20 . She first heard aboutSwamiji from the Swedenborg Ian 21 minister of a little townin Ohio The latter had told her that Swamiji was \u201cone speaker(at the Parliament of Religions) who stood above all others,because of his learning, his eloquence, and his impressivepersonality\u201d. She had become immediately interested in himbecause the spiritual teachings of India were not unfamiliar toher. She had read Edwin Arnold\u2019s Light of Asia and MohiniChatterjee\u2019s translation of the Gita and had spent long hours inthe previous winter in the study of Max Muller\u2019s English versionof the Upanishads. One day, while walking along MadisonAvenue, she saw in the window of the Hall of the UniversalBrotherhood a modest sign saying, \u201cNext Sunday at 3 p.m.Swami Vivekananda will speak here on `What is Vedanta?\u2019and the following Sunday on `What is Yoga?\u2019\u201d. She says:\u201cI reached the hall twenty minutes before the hour. Itwas already over half full. It was not large, however. . . Thehall was on the second storey and. . . (the flight of stairs at theback) gave the only way of access to it. By the time three o\u2019clockarrived, hall, stairs, windowsills and railings, all were crowdedto the utmost capacity. Many even were standing below, hopingVEDANTA CLASSES IN NEW YORKSWAMI VIVEKANANDA978to catch a faint echo of the words spoken in the hall above. . .A sudden hush, a quiet step on the stairs and SwamiVivekananda passed in stately erectness up the aisle to theplatform. He began to speak; and memory, time, place, people,all melted away. Nothing was left but a voice ringing throughthe void. It was as if a gate had swung open and I had passedout on a road leading to limitless attainment. The end of it wasnot visible; but the promise of what it would be shone throughthe thought and flashed through the personality of the one whogave it. He stood there \u2014 the prophet of infinitude. . . Thesilence of an empty hall recalled me to myself. .\u201dThe meeting that Miss Glenn attended was possibly oneat which Swamiji gave a public lecture, and probably pertainedto the early months of 1895. She may after this have attendedother public lectures of Swamiji and found out 54 West 33rdStreet, \u2014 later, in the latter half of 1896, also 228, West 39thStreet, where Swamiji delivered his second series of Vedantalectures, and regularly attended all the lectures delivered inboth places. When, many years later, in 1932, she wrote herreminiscences of the Vedanta classes of 1895 and 1896 in thePrabuddha Bharata , her memory was evidently failing her.Correct about the generalities she was wrong about particularevents, and she was confused about the years, so that somelectures she had heard in 1895, she ascribed to 1896 and viceversa . This will appear from the extracts quoted by us. \u201cSomeof us,\u201d says she, \u201cnever missed a meeting. We followed thecourse of bhaktiyoga and the course of jnanayoga . We walkedsimultaneously along the paths of rajayoga and karmayoga .We were almost sorry that there were only four yogas. We wouldhave liked to have six or eight, that the number of classes mightbe multiplied\u201d. \u201cThere was,\u201d she goes on to say, \u201ca final Sunday( sic ) lecture \u2014 My Master. He seemed to be less confident,979as if he approached his task reluctantly. Years after, in Madras,I understood. He hesitated at all times to speak of his guru.During his early wanderings through South India he refused toreveal his name even, believing he represented him so poorly.Only in Madras, did the words burst from his lips: `That is myguru. Sri Ramakrishna,\u2019 and tears streamed down his face. . .\u201d(We know, however, that, a little earlier, he had revealed thename of his guru to some people at Kanyakumari, see above,Chapter 6, Section X.)Another reference we have to the Vedanta classes is inthe Reminiscences of Miss Josephine MacLeod 22 , who alongwith her sister, then Mrs. Sturges (later Mrs. Leggett), first cameto hear Swamiji at 54 West 33rd Street on 29 January 1895 ,that is, on the very first, or the second day of the opening of theVedanta classes. She soon came to have an important place inthe intimate personal circle of Swamiji, being called by him,as she used to be called by members of her family, as Yum,Joe, or Joe Joe. Swamiji addressed her so also in his letters toher, some of which, we may say incidentally, contain thesublimest thoughts that were characteristically his. She did notcount herself as one among his disciples and considered thatshe was \u201cnever anything but a friend\u201d. But she must have haddeep spiritual carvings, being, even before she met Swamiji,given to meditations and knowing the Gita by heart. She firstlearnt about Swamiji from a friend, a certain Mrs. DoraRoethlisberger who, says she, \u201cafter Vivekananda,.. was themost spiritual person I ever met\u201d. This lady seems to have beenan occultist, but possibly had real spiritual leanings too, for,some days after Miss MacLeod had been listening to Swamiji\u2019slectures, she accompanied her on a private visit to Swamiji.They asked him to tell them how to meditate, and he told them,\u201cMeditate on the word `Om\u2019 for a week and come again andVEDANTA CLASSES IN NEW YORKSWAMI VIVEKANANDA980tell me\u201d. They did so and narrated their experiences to him.Mrs. Roethlisberger said, \u201cI see a light\u201d. Miss MacLeod said,\u201cOh no, it is more like a glow at the heart\u201d. Swamiji told her,\u201cGood, keep on\u201d. Miss MacLeod says that that was all thatSwamiji taught her. One may think that that was all that wasneeded for her (and her friend\u2019s) initiation, which variesaccording to the needs and capacities of the disciples. ThoughMiss MacLeod is extremely reticent on the subject, it seemsthat her education did not end here, for she adds that Swamijimade her realize that there was nothing secular in life: it wasall holy. \u201cAlways remember,\u201d Swamiji told her, \u201cthat you areincidentally an American and a woman, but always a child ofGod. Tell yourself day and night who you are. Never forget it\u201d.Miss MacLeod also says that Swamiji\u2019s presence was dynamic,and that one cannot pass that power on  unless one has it.Obviously, Swamiji passed `power\u2019 on to her.Her narration of her experiences on the first day of herattending his class is worth stating in her own words. \u201cOn thetwenty-ninth of January 1895, I went with my sister to 54 West33rd Street, New York, and heard the Swami Vivekananda inhis sitting room where were assembled fifteen or twenty ladiesand two or three gentlemen. The room was crowded. All thearmchairs were taken; so I sat on the floor in the front row.Swami stood in the corner. He said something, the particularwords of which I do not remember, but instantly to me thatwas truth, and the second sentence he spoke was truth, and thethird sentence was truth. And I listened to him for seven yearsand whatever he uttered was to me truth. From that momentlife had a different import. It was as if he made you realize thatyou were in eternity. It never altered. It was like the sun thatyou will never forget once you have seen. . I heard him all thatwinter, three days a week, mornings at eleven o\u2019clock. I never981spoke to him, but as we were so regular in coming, two frontseats were always kept for us in this sitting room of Swamiji.One day he turned and said, `Are you sisters?\u2019 `Yes\u2019, weanswered. Then he said, `Do you come from very far?\u2019 Wesaid, `No, not very far \u2014 about thirty miles up the Hudson\u2019.`So far? That is wonderful\u2019. These were the first words I everspoke to him\u201d.We have to remember that even after Swamiji had openedthe Vedanta classes at New York on 28 or 29 January 1895, theseries of lectures that had been arranged at Brooklyn by theEthical Association continued to be delivered, off and on, forsome time, the last of them being delivered on 7 April. AsMiss Waldo informs us, some of those (like herself) who heardhim in Brooklyn, began to go to his classes at New York, and itappears that it was partly because of this that the latter grewvery rapidly. She tells us that they were held every morningand on several evenings every week. There were Sundaylectures also and there were \u201cquestion classes\u201d to help those towhom the teaching was so new and strange that they neededmore extended explanation. Many did not miss a class and,says Sister Devamata, if Swamiji tentatively suggested omittinga class because of a holiday, or for some other reason, therewas a loud protest always. \u201cNot a sentence went unrecorded,\u201dsays she. On the last day, Sunday ( sic ), 24 February 1896,when Swamiji delivered his lecture on his Master his first bookwas published. For some time before this, on every Sunday,the lecture delivered on the previous Sunday was being put upfor sale in book form on a table. All his lectures on KarmaYoga were now published in the form of a big book which wasprinted closely on thin paper. In the next edition the book hadquite a different look. It was not good-looking, but those whohad laboured to bring it out were proud of it. Swamiji\u2019s workVEDANTA CLASSES IN NEW YORKSWAMI VIVEKANANDA982in New York came to a close after he had delivered anotherlecture as a supplement to the foregoing ones. 23We learn from The Life 24 that though regular classes didnot begin till February, numbers upon numbers of peopleflocked to him daily, among whom were newspaper reportersand editors of magazines who were bent on spreading his nameand his teachings before the public. Yet, with the exception ofthe lectures delivered at Brooklyn, nothing including his publiclectures at New York of this period, seems to have appeared inthe press. As we have seen earlier, it was not till the first weekof January, 1896 that, as Swamiji said, the newspapers againtook him up. The lectures delivered in the first half of 1895mostly concerned Raja Yoga and Jnana Yoga . According toMiss Waldo, the New York lectures on Jnana Yoga were neverpublished, those in book form bearing the name Jnana Yogabeing what he delivered in England and India. When after hisfirst visit to England, Swamiji returned to New York, andreopened the Vedanta classes, in December 1895, his disciplesengaged the services of a young Englishman, Mr. J. J. Goodwin,who was a court stenographer, which meant two hundred wordsper minute. After the first week, according to Miss MacLeod,Goodwin refused any money. He soon became strongly attachedto Swamiji and to the cause but, as Mrs. Burke has pointedout, he was persuaded to take a small amount that was justsufficient for a bare living. He occasionally eked it out byworking here and there at leisure hours. His family was verypoor and needed his help. The fruits of his labours in NewYork are known to us in the books, Raja Yoga, Bhakti Yogaand Karma Yoga , besides several pamphlets of the Sundaylectures. He was the Swami\u2019s self-appointed Secretary \u2014 hisright hand as the Master called him \u2014 accompanying himwhosesoever he went, visiting Detroit and Boston, when the983Swami went to those places in the spring of 1896 and, later,England, and even India where he died. According to The Life, Swamiji\u2019s work on Raja Yoga was completed about June,1895 but, as pointed out by Mrs. Burke, (by reference to hisletters to Mr. Sturdy dated 23 December 1895 and 16 January1896), was actually written later, 25 Miss Waldo being hisamanuensis. The manner in which it was composed isinteresting. Says Miss Waldo about it, \u201cIt was inspiring to seethe Swami as he dictated to me the contents of the work. Indelivering his commentaries on the Sutras, he would leave mewaiting while he entered deep states of meditation or selfcontemplation, to emerge therefrom with some luminousinterpretations. I had always to keep the pen dipped in ink. Hemight be absorbed for long periods of time and then suddenlyhis silence would be broken by some expression or some longdeliberate teaching\u201d. Romain Rolland is not quite fair toAmerica when he says that it was attracted to the teachings ofRaja Yoga because it promised  material power. As he himselfadmits, it attracted the attention of American physiologists,like William James, as later it roused the enthusiasm of Tolstoy.Swami Abhedananda says that he met many people in Americawho regarded Swamiji\u2019s Raja Yoga in the same light as themost devout Christian regarded his own scriptures.Even though, as we have said above, the newspapersgave little publicity to Swamiji\u2019s work and teachings duringthis period, there were numerous people of the undesirable sort,who rushed at his gates, threatening to wreck his classes. Theywere described by Swami Kripananda (Leon Landsberg) in aletter of his to the Brahmavadin in 1896. They were peoplelike the spiritualists who advocated the most absurd theoriesand irrational doctrines with a view to satisfying the morbidcarving for \u201cthe abnormal, the occult and the sensational\u201d ofVEDANTA CLASSES IN NEW YORKSWAMI VIVEKANANDA984the credulous folk. They carried on a profitable trade, oftencharging $ 25 to $ 100 as initiation fees, and attempted to induceSwamiji to join them in their fraudulent business, first bypromises of support, and then by threats of injuring him if herefused to ally himself with them. They were grievouslydisappointed: for the first time they had met a man who couldbe neither bought nor frightened. Swamiji told them, \u201cI standfor Truth. Truth will never ally itself with falsehood. Even ifall the world be against me, Truth must prevail in the end\u201d.Others who asked for his alliance were his old friends, theChristian missionaries, who wanted him to preach Christianityas they understood it and, when he refused, tried to harm himin every way, as we have seen, going to the length of vilifyinghim personally, etc.,Yet others who sought his cooperation and attempted toharm him when he refused to join hands with them were theTheosophists. There was a time during his early days in Americawhen, being in straits, he had wired to his friends in Madrasfor help, and this coming to be known to the Theosophists,their chief had remarked, \u201cLet the devil die of cold\u201d. After hehad made a name for himself in the Parliament, theTheosophists had realized their mistake and attempted to maketheir peace with him. They approached him in the guise offriends, and sought to create the impression in the circle of hisfollowers in India, particularly Madras, that they were hisfriends, or even that they had paved the path for his success inAmerica. 26 It seems that in doing this they had some successeven with Alasinga, whom we find Swamiji repeatedly warningagainst the wiles of the Theosophists. As late as 23 January1896, we find him warning Alasinga, \u201cAre you going to jointhe Theosophists?. . Any suspicion of my connection with theTheosophists will spoil my work both in America and England,985and well it may. They are thought by all people of sound mindto be wrong, and true it is that they are held so, and you knowit full well. I am afraid you want to overreach me. . . Hoistyour flag and give public notice in your paper (theBrahmavadin) that you have given up all connection with me,and join the camp of the Theosophists or cease to have anythingto do with them\u201d. 27 It appears from a letter written by Swamijito Mr. Sturdy on 2 August 1895 that the Theosophists attemptedto infiltrate his classes in New York and failed in the attempt.In this letter Swamiji said, \u201cSome Theosophists came to myclasses in New York, but as soon as human beings perceive theglory of the Vedanta, all abradacadabras fall off of themselves\u201d.28 As we have seen above, they had joined hands with theChristian missionaries in India and America in their efforts toharm Swamiji.There was still another class of people (a worthierantagonist, as Landsberg calls them), viz., the so-calledfreethinkers, embracing the atheists, materialists, agnostics,rationalists and some others who, on principle, were averse toanything that  savours of religion and who stood against him.In his youth Swamiji himself had been a freethinker and arationalist, and challenged the claims of religion, which weresupposed to rest on faith. We have seen that while in Madras,he had met young men, drunk with the heady wine of Westernscience and turned atheists, challenging him to define God,and becoming nonplussed when he asked them to define sucha simple word as energy which was on their lips always. Hehad come across these \u201cscientists\u201d also in America, and wehave seen how at a meeting with them at Detroit he hadconfounded them with his Knowledge about up-to-date bookson various branches of science. Cornelia Conger, to whosememoirs we have referred in an earlier chapter, tells us aboutVEDANTA CLASSES IN NEW YORKSWAMI VIVEKANANDA986Swamiji\u2019s meeting at a supper party with a group of younguniversity professors, who had boasted that they could \u201cshowup\u201d his religious beliefs in no time. The \u201cyoung intellectuals\u201dwho included Cornelia Conger\u2019s aunt and her husband, wereastounded at Swamiji\u2019s great knowledge of the Bible and theQuran as well as the various oriental religions, his grasp ofscience and of psychology. The \u201cdoubting Thomas\u2019s\u201d had tothrow up their hands and they parted from him with the warmestadmiration and affection. 29A group of scientists, cocksure of triumph like thosedescribed above, now invited Swamiji to have a discussionwith them one evening at New York. \u201cI shall never forget thatmemorable evening,\u201d says Landsberg, \u201cwhen Swamiji acceptedthe challenge and appeared singlehanded to face the matadorsof materialism. . . Imagine their surprise when they found that,far from being intimidated by (their big words), he provedhimself a master in wielding their own weapons, and as familiarwith the arguments of materialism as he was with those of theAdvaita philosophy. He showed them that their much vauntedwestern civilization consisted principally in the developmentof the art to destroy  their fellowmen, that their western sciencecould not answer the most vital questions of life and being,that their immutable laws, so much talked of, had no outsideexistence apart from the human mind, that the very idea ofmatter was a metaphysical conception, and that it was the muchdespised metaphysics upon which ultimately rested the verybasis of their materialism. With an irresistible logic hedemonstrated that their knowledge proved itself incorrect, notby comparison with knowledge which is true, but by the verylaws upon which it depends for its basis; that pure reasoningcould not help admitting its own limitations and pointed tosomething beyond reason; and that rationalism when carried987to its last consequences must ultimately land at a somethingwhich is above matter, above force, above sense, above thoughtand even consciousness, and of which all these are butmanifestations\u201d. Landsberg mentions that the very next day ofSwamiji\u2019s lectures, numbers of the materialistic camp came tosit at his feet, and listen to his sublime utterances on God andreligion. 30It is amazing to reflect upon the amount of labourSwamiji went through at this time. Besides lecturing in hisclasses as well as in private homes and public places andmeeting those who challenged him to hold disputations withthemselves, he daily and regularly trained some chosenfollowers how to practice quietude of mind in the silence ofmeditation. While teaching these pupils how to meditate hewould sometimes lose himself in meditation \u2014 on a fewoccasions sinking so deep the plummet of personality into theabyss of spiritual introspection that he could not be readilybrought to, and, as Sister Nivedita has told us, his students,fearing that he had passed away, would quietly steal away.Swamiji felt dissatisfied with himself when he came forth fromthese states, for he desired that the Teacher more than the Yogishould be uppermost in him and, while  privately meditatingwith one or two pupils, would give them a word or a name bywhich he could be recalled to normal consciousness.Oftentimes, he might be found singing Sanskrit hymns in gentletones, or murmuring to himself some of the great slokas of theVedas and the Upanishads. \u201cIndeed, that same atmosphere ofecstasy and insight that hovered above the Master atDakshineswar now hovered above the Swami in these strangesurroundings in a far-off land\u201d. It was not, however, his studentsand listeners at his meetings who alone received his help andbenediction. In this connection one may recall a story whichVEDANTA CLASSES IN NEW YORKSWAMI VIVEKANANDA988has been told by Sister Christine, and which shows how all-embracing was his sympathy and compassion. Once a pitifulgroup had clung to Swamiji with pathetic tenacity. He hadgathered them up first one and then another in course of a walkand they returned with him to the house of the Vedanta Society.\u201cWalking up the flight of steps leading to the front door, theone beside him thought, `Why does he attract such queerabnormal people?\u2019 Quick as a flash he turned and answeredthe unspoken thought, `You see, they are Siva\u2019s demons\u2019.\u201d 31To complete the picture of Swamiji\u2019s life at this time (so far asit is possible to do so) it has to be added that all his spare hourswere spent in studying \u2014 not only big works on the Vedantabut on all secular subjects as well. Moreover, India beingconstantly in his thoughts, he was, as we have stated in anearlier Chapter, busy planning the work to be carried out byhis disciples, writing many letters to them \u2014 encouraging,scolding, directing them.Some idea of the character of Swamiji\u2019s teaching in theVedanta classes may be given here, since \u2014 intended thoughit was for serious spiritual aspirants \u2014 it has lessons for all, \u2014 the dabblers in the occult and the clients of Beauty Parloursalone being excluded. The lectures at his classes in the firsthalf of 1895 were, as we have said above, largely on Raja Yogaand Jnana Yoga . Raja Yoga is the practical assimilation ofSpiritual Insight by the inner control of the functions of thesenses. Romain Rolland says that \u201cif by Yoga we mean unionwith the supreme object (and subject) of Knowledge, Raja Yogais the experimental psychophysiological method for its directattainment\u201d. 32 Swamiji told his students that religion was nota question of belief, but of practice, and accordingly prescribedfor them certain spiritual and physical exercises by which thebody and the mind could be trained into equilibrium. There989were eight processes of restraining the mind. The first was Yama, or the control of the physical nature which includes moralityin all its aspects. \u201cEven the first stage,\u201d says Romain Rolland,\u201cis unattainable \u2014 the Yama or mastery \u2014 without thefulfillment of five indispensable conditions each one sufficientto make a saint\u201d. These are: (1) Ahimsa , the great aim ofGandhi, (2) Absolute truthfulness (\u201cTwelve years of absolutetruthfulness in thought, word, and deed,\u201d said Swamiji, \u201cgivesa man what he will.\u201d), (3) Perfect chastity or brahmacharya ,(4) Absolute no covetousness, and (5) Purity of soul anddisinterestedness. 33The second of the processes is Niyama , \u201cnot allowingthe mind to wander in any direction\u201d. The third is Asana, orposture, the best being that \u201cwhich can be kept longest withthe greatest ease\u201d. Then should be practised Pranayama, therestraint of the breath, both in its inward and in its outwardfunction. This was to be succeeded by Pratyahara , the drawingin of the organs from their objects and by Dharana, or theholding the mind to the object of thought. These processes,Swamiji said, would bring success if followed properly,certainly within the period of twelve years, and long beforethis according to the tendency and the rapidity in developmentof each practitioner. One sees from the very names of theseexercises that Raja Yoga is practical mysticism and that itnaturally leads to the remaining  division of this science, namely,Dhyana or deep contemplation and, finally, Samadhi . In orderto achieve success, Swamiji said, the students were to liveabsolutely pure lives, and eat satvic food, else the Yoga practicesmight lead to insanity. He himself lived the simple, austere lifeof the Yogin. 34 He put into living practice what he preached.Throughout, his mind constantly concerned itself with superVEDANTA CLASSES IN NEW YORKSWAMI VIVEKANANDA990mundane realities. In the silent hours of meditation his soulwithdrew within itself in the ecstasy of insight. 35Swamiji\u2019s scientific turn of mind gave him a deep insightinto the psychology of Yoga exercises, and he tested everythingby a rational practice. His theories of the makeup of the nervoussystem of its relation to the brain, his statements as to therelation between the mind and nervous changes, drew theattention of noted America physicians and physiologists, andseveral championed his theories, avowing that they were worthyof careful investigation. His claim that meditation brought aboutthe extension and development of human faculties and arousedsupernormal experiences, hitherto classified as miraculousphenomena, interested Prof. William James to make a studyof the variety of religious experiences. 36 Similarly, hisexposition of the Sankhya philosophy later on interested thegreat electrician, Nicholas Tesla, who admitted the superiorityof its cosmogony and the rational theories of the Kalpas (cycle),prana , and akasa , which he said he could prove evenmathematically. 371895 was the year of Swamiji\u2019s hardest work in America,of his highest hopes, and of his greatest endeavours to gain anumber of souls of whom he could be sure that they wouldcarry on his work. He had all manner of plans: he longed, attimes, for an organization that would represent his ideas andaspirations. He was personally satisfied about the success ofhis labours; he felt that he was carrying on his work, slowly,perhaps, but on a right footing. Formerly, he had stood merelyin the limelight of public attention and, as we have seen, thatdid not satisfy him. He had no desire for success as the worldconceives it and as his wealthy friends wanted him to achieveit. He had cut himself off from the Lecture Bureau, and from991his grande dame patrons. It was not for nothing that he hadtaken mean lodgings in an unfashionable quarter of New York.He lived on the simplest food, often cooked by himself, andshunned the commonest amenities of living. He did not care ifa handful of people attended his classes, or if he had a full hall,and to a disciple who was surprised at the smallness ofattendance at one of his lectures he said, \u201cI could have thousandsmore at my lectures if I wanted them. It is the sincere studentwho will help to make this work a success and not merelylarge audiences. If I succeed in all my life in helping one manto reach freedom, I shall feel that my labours have not been invain, but quite successful\u201d.Even then doubts sometimes assailed the Swami\u2019s mindand in spite of his indomitable will and vigour, he felt worriedand exhausted. The Life 38 quotes the following from a letter ofhis to Mrs. Bull as indicating a mood he fell into occasionallyat this time, \u201cI long, oh long, for my rags, my shaven head, mysleep under the trees, and my food from begging\u201d. Though thisletter was probably written in January 1896 and not \u201cas earlyas January 1895\u201d as The Life has it, this trend of thought wasever present in his mind, as the following lines of the sameletter tell us. \u201cI am satisfied in my consciousness,\u201d wrote he,\u201cthat I did not remain an idle Swami. I have a notebook whichhas travelled with me all over the world. I find these wordswritten seven years ago \u2014 `Now to seek a corner and lay myselfthere to die\u2019. Yet all this Karma remained. I hope I have workedit out. I hope the Lord will give me freedom from this preachingand adding good bondages\u201d. 39 He had not worked out hisKarma, and the Lord evidently had other thoughts about him.As a matter of fact, though we have no doubt that at timesthoughts like the above crossed his mind, he worked hard allthrough 1895, as we have said above. On 21 March 1895, heVEDANTA CLASSES IN NEW YORKSWAMI VIVEKANANDA992was writing to the same Mrs. Bull, \u201cWell, I will have to workhard and must succeed. . .That is why I desire so much to havea centre. Organization has its faults, no doubt, but without thatnothing can be done. . . One must work as the dictate comesfrom within, and then if it is right and good, society is bound toveer round, perhaps centuries after one is dead and gone\u201d. 40The most unfortunate part of the whole business wasthat his health was breaking down. \u201cHe began to feel himselfwearying out,\u201d says The Life . 41 \u201cHe found his nerves wrecked,his brain tired, his whole personality exhausted\u201d. He did notgive an inkling of this in his letters during this period, and onthe contrary sought to give the impression that he was welland even gaining in undesirable weight. On 22 June 1895 hewrote to Mary Hale, \u201cLandsberg has gone away to live in someother place, so I am left alone. I am living mostly on nuts andfruits and milk, and find it very nice and healthy too. I hope tolose about 30 to 40 lbs. this summer\u201d. 42 From his letter toMrs. Sturges from Thousand Island Park in July 1895, however,we know that he was suffering from sleeplessness in theprevious months in New York. \u201cAll the sleep of the world,\u201dsaid he in this letter, \u201chas come upon me. I sleep at least twohours during the day and sleep through the whole night as apiece of log. This is a reaction, I think, from the sleeplessnessof New York. . . I am determined that several pounds of my fatshall be off before I leave\u201d. 43 But he wrote later in the yearfrom England to Swami Brahmananda, \u201cAnother thing, myincessant lecturing tours are making me nervous, causinginsomnia, and other troubles\u201d. 44After Landsberg had left him (See Note No. 13) themanagement of the \u201chousehold\u201d became much more difficultfor Swamiji, for he had to do everything now unaided. The993finances became lower still because Landsberg had a positionon a New York paper which required but little of his time andgave him a small income (as we learn from Sister Christine), 45which was helpful. Landsberg\u2019s moral and intellectualsympathies had made him an agreeable companion for Swamiji.\u201cHe had all the qualities of his race (by birth, as we have seen,he was Russian Jew, by naturalization an American citizen) \u2014 emotion, imagination, a passion for learning, and a worshipof genius. . . His intimate knowledge of Europe, itsphilosophies, its languages, its culture, gave him a profundityand depth of mind which are rare. He was fiery, and picturesque.His indifference to his personal appearance, his fanaticism,his pity for the poor, which amounted to a passion, drewSwamiji to him. He often gave his last penny to a beggar, andalways out of a poverty almost as great as the recipient\u2019s. . .Afterthe classes were over at night they would go out for a walk,ending with a light meal which was inexpensive, as the commonpurse was often empty. This did not trouble either of them\u201d. 46After Landsberg had left, an important work that he used to doin connection with the conducting of the Vedanta classes, viz.,taking down the names of those who were present in the classesand giving notices, which constituted, as Swamiji said, a \u201cbigtask\u201d, was, it seems, for a time done by Miss Hamlin. In aletter to Mrs. Bull dated 25 April 1895, however, Swamiji toldher that he was thoroughly persuaded that it was laziness onhis part, and therefore immoral, to depend on others, and thathenceforth he would do it all by himself. 47Encouraged by the success of his work in New York,Swamiji planned to pay a visit to England and deliver hismessage there \u2014 an idea that was always present in his mindfrom his earliest days in America. In a letter to Alasinga writtenon 20 August 1893, at a time when he was trying desperatelyVEDANTA CLASSES IN NEW YORKSWAMI VIVEKANANDA994to obtain a foothold in America, he had said, \u201cFirst I will try inAmerica; and if I fail, try in England. . .\u201d 48 One year later, on31 August 1894, he had written to him \u2014 not out of despairbut in a spirit of self-confidence, \u201cEverything done here(America) prepares England \u201c 49 On 26 (?) October 1894, hewrote to Isabelle McKindley, \u201cI intend going over to Englandthis winter somewhere in January or February. A lady fromLondon (Miss Muller?) with whom one of my friends (AkshayKumar Ghosh?) is staying has sent an invitation to me to goover as her guest; and from India they are urging me every dayto come back\u201d. 50 As we know, this did not turn up, neither didhe return to India, and, instead, he threw himself into the vortexof his Vedanta work in New York. As we shall see later, thevisit came off some six months later, when fresh opportunitiespresented themselves.Swamiji was able to snatch a few days\u2019 rest at the fagend of his arduous labours in his Vedanta classes, where a crisiswas developing on account of paucity of funds (another reasonwhy he wanted to get away), as we learn from what he wroteto Mrs. Bull in May, 1895 (exact date not known). \u201cThe classesare going on; but I am sorry to say, though the attendance islarge, it does not even pay enough to cover the rent. I will trythis week and then give up\u201d. 51 Through Miss MacLeod,Swamiji had come to know Mr. Francis Leggett, a wealthy andcultured man, who became sincerely interested in Vedanta andin Swamiji and remained his lifelong disciple and friend. Heinvited Swamiji to stay with him at his fishing camp at Percyin New Hampshire, where Miss MacLeod and Mrs. Sturgeswere also staying with him and where his engagement withMrs. Sturges either had already been, or was shortly to beannounced. (He was a widower and she a widow.) At this time,as Sister Christine tells us \u2014 quoting from a letter written by995Swamiji to Mrs. Bull in May, 1895 \u2014 Swamiji had receivedan invitation to speak at a Parliament of Religions at Toronto,Canada, on 18 July 1895. (We have no information whetherSwamiji actually attended this meeting). At this time also,Swamiji had already accepted the suggestion of one of his pupilsat the Vedanta classes that he should spend the summer at acottage owned by her at Thousand Island Park.About Swamiji\u2019s classes at Thousand Island Park we shallspeak in the following section. The ten days he spent with hisfriends at Percy refreshed him spiritually, mentally, physically.\u201cFor his work at Thousand Island Park,\u201d says The Life , 52 \u201chisshort stay at Percy, New Hampshire, evidently fitted him\u201d. In aletter to Mrs. Bull dated 7 June 1895, the day on which hearrived there, Swamiji spoke about his life there as follows, \u201cIam here at last with Mr. Leggett. This is one of the mostbeautiful spots I have ever seen. Imagine a lake surroundedwith hills covered with a huge forest, with nobody but ourselves.So lovely, so quiet, so restful. . . It gives me a new lease of lifeto be here. I go into the forest alone and read my Gita and amquite happy\u201d. 53 A little more information about his stay at thisplace is to be found in Miss MacLeod\u2019s reminiscences. \u201cWhilehe was at the Camp,\u201d says she, \u201cSwami would go out underthose beautiful white birch trees and meditate for hours. Withouttelling us anything about it he made two beautiful birch barkbooks, written in Sanskrit and English, which he gave to mysister and me\u201d. 54 He did not forget his sisters at Chicago in thematter of sending a present like this to them also. A day beforehe left for Thousand Island Park, 17 June 1895, he sent them aletter written on a birch bark, which concluded with the words,\u201cThis is the bark on which all holy writings are written in India.So I write Sanskrit: May the husband of Uma (Siva) protectyou always\u201d. 55 So intensive were Swamiji\u2019s meditations atVEDANTA CLASSES IN NEW YORKSWAMI VIVEKANANDA996Percy that once he passed into nirvikalpa samadhi . The storyis told by Miss MacLeod that on this occasion he wasdiscovered by a gardener \u2014 to all appearances dead. Failingto bring him back to consciousness, Mr. Leggett and the twowomen were about to accept the incredible fact of his havingpassed away when he came to. 56 Living always in communionwith the Highest, says The Life , 57 \u201cit was little wonder that hecame forth from the solitude a very avalanche of spirituality,making his disciples realize many forms of Truth at but a glance,or touch, or wish.\u201dIIIAs we have seen above, the New York work put an intolerablestrain on Swamiji and in May, 1895, if also for financial reasons,he was thinking of giving up the Vedanta classes. His disciples,many of whom were too poor to provide the necessary funds,as we learn from Sister Devamata, protested against anysuggestion for a suspension of them even for a day, and so theclasses went on till Mr. Leggett\u2019s invitation gave Swami atemporary relief. Before he left for Percy, however, his discipleswere anxious to have from him a promise that he should returnand continue the work. Swamiji demurred against the idea thathe should prolong his work at a tension through the hot weather;besides, many of his students had arranged to leave New Yorkfor seaside or mountain resorts. In the language of Miss Waldo,who has left us a charming account of this episode of Swamiji\u2019slife as well as invaluable notes taken down by her at the talkssince known as the Inspired Talks , \u201cthe problem solved itself\u201d.One of his disciples, Miss Mary Elizabeth Dutcher, who owneda cottage at Thousand Island Park, the largest island in the St.Lawrence river, about 300 miles from New York, offered theuse of it to Swamiji and as many of the students at the Vedanta997classes as it would accommodate. Swamiji accepted the offerremarking that those who would leave all other interests anddevote themselves to Vedanta, travelling to a place so far away,would be recognized by him as his disciples. He did not expectmany would take so much trouble but, if any responded, hewould do his share of helping them on the path, he said. At thistime, he had received an invitation again to attend the GreenacreConference, but he preferred to go to Thousand Island Park,because, as he wrote to Mrs. Bull, he wanted \u201cto manufacturea few Yogis out of the materials of the classes, and a busy farmlike Greenacre is the last place for that, while the other is quiteout of the way, and none of the curiosity seekers will dare gothere\u201d. \u201cHis second object,\u201d as says Sister Christine, \u201cnot soapparent perhaps, but always in the undercurrent, was to trainthis group to carry on the work in America. `This messagemust be preached by Indians in India, and by Americans inAmerica\u2019, he said.\u201d 58Delightful descriptions of the cottage in Thousand IslandPark are given by Miss Waldo, Sister Christine, and Mrs. Funke,who belonged to the devoted group of pupils who participatedin the life there. The place was ideally situated on high groundoverlooking a wide strip of the St. Lawrence river (remindingSwamiji of the holy Ganga on which stood Dakshineswar, towhich the place itself, in certain respects, e.g., its solitude andthe sylvan surroundings, bore a resemblance). The cottage wasbuilt upon a rock (was that symbolic? asks Sister Christine),and huge boulders lay all around it. It included a newly builtwing meant exclusively for the use of Swamiji \u2014 \u201da true loveoffering to her Teacher\u201d by Miss Dutcher. This wing stood onthe steep slope of the rocks like a great lantern tower withwindows on three sides, three storeys deep at the back, andonly two in front. The lower room was occupied by one of theSWAMIJI AT THOUSAND ISLAND PARKSWAMI VIVEKANANDA998students. The one over it opened out of the main part of thehouse by several doors and, being large and convenient, becamethe classroom. Over this room was the one devoted exclusivelyto the use of Swamiji. In order that it might be perfectlysecluded, Miss Dutcher had supplied it with a separate outsidestaircase, although there was also a door opening upon thesecond storey of the piazza (veranda).The upstairs piazza played an important part in the livesof the students as all Swamiji\u2019s evening talks were given there.It was wide and roomy and was screened off on the west sideby a partition with a view to preventing strangers, who used tofrequent it to see the magnificent view it commanded, fromintruding upon their privacy. It was a veritable sanctuary. Attheir feet, like a sea of green, waved the leaves of the tree tops,for the entire place was surrounded by thick woods. Beyondthe trees spread the wide expanse of the St. Lawrence, dottedhere and there with islands, some of which gleamed brightwith the light of hotels and boardinghouses. All these were sofar away that they seemed more like a pictured scene than areality. Part of the time the scene was illumined by the softrays of the moon and her face was mirrored in the shining watersbeneath. In this scene of enchantment, \u201cthe world forgetting,and by the world forgot\u201d, the devoted students spent sevenblessed weeks with their beloved Teacher listening to his wordsof inspiration. \u201cOne could not have believed,\u201d says SisterChristine, \u201cthat such a spot could be found in America. Whatgreat ideas were voiced there! What an atmosphere was created,what power was generated! There the Teacher reached someof his loftiest flights, there he showed us his heart and mind.We saw ideas unfold and flower. We saw the evolution of planswhich grew into institutions in the years that followed. It wasa blessed experience \u2014 an experience which made Miss Waldo999exclaim, `What have we ever done to deserve this?\u2019 and so weall felt\u201d. 59Swamiji arrived at Thousand Island Park on 18 June1895, and stayed there till 6 August. He returned to New Yorkon 7 August and sailed thence for Europe on 17 August. Threeor four pupils had arrived at Thousand Island park earlier, andthe lectures began on 19 June 1895. \u201cBy a singularcoincidence\u201d, the number of pupils at Thousand Island Parkwas `just twelve\u201d, but not more than ten were ever presenttogether in the classes. The earliest to arrive were probably,besides the hostess, Miss Dutcher, the three friends,Miss Waldo, Miss Ruth Ellis, and Dr. Wight of Cambridge, andthe latest to do so were probably Miss Greenstidel (later SisterChristine) and Mrs. Mary C. Funke. The two last named hadlistened to and been enraptured by Swamiji\u2019s lectures at Detroitbut not met him personally there, though they had resolvedsoon afterwards \u201cto find him some time, somewhere, even ifwe had to go across the world to do it\u201d. They had lost trace ofhim for about a year and a half and even concluded that he hadreturned to India, when one afternoon they learned that he wasstill in the country and spending the summer at Thousand IslandPark. They decided to start the next morning, resolved to seekhim out and ask him to teach them.A touching description of the first meeting of these twodevoted souls with one whom they had travelled seven hundredmiles to meet is given by Mrs. Funke. \u201cWe were nearlyfrightened to death when we finally reached the cottage,\u201d saysshe, \u201cfor neither the Swami nor his followers at the ThousandIsland Park had the remotest idea of our existence. . . It was adark, rainy night, but we could not wait. . . We did not know asoul in the place. . . At one place we were told that there was aSWAMIJI AT THOUSAND ISLAND PARKSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1000cottage occupied by a Miss Dutcher and that a `foreign lookingman who dressed queerly\u2019 was staying there. Then we knewour quest was ended, and we found a man with a lantern whowent ahead of us.. Up, up the wet slippery path! It seemed as ifwe were taking one step up and two back, it was so slippery.The first thing we heard when we reached the house was therich beautiful voice of the Swami who was talking to thosewho had gathered on the porch. . .\u201d 60\u201cSpeaking of this in after years, our Guru would refer tous as `my disciples, who travelled hundreds of miles to findme and they came in the night and in the rain\u2019. We had thoughtof what to say to him, but when we realized that we had reallyfound him, we instantly forgot all our fine speeches and one ofus blurted out, `We came from Detroit and Mrs. P.(Miss Phillips) sent us to you\u2019. The other said, `We have cometo you just as we would go to Jesus if He were still on earth,and ask Him to teach us\u2019. He looked at us so kindly and saidgently, `If only I possessed the power of the Christ to set youfree now\u2019. He stood for a moment looking thoughtful and thenturning to his hostess who was standing near, said, `These ladiesare from Detroit, please show them upstairs and allow them tospend the evening with us\u2019. We remained until late listening tothe Master who paid no more attention to us but, as we badethem all good night, we were told to come the next morning atnine o\u2019clock. We arrived promptly, and to our great joy wereaccepted by the Master and were cordially invited to becomemembers of the household\u201d. 61 This happened on Saturday, 6July 1895.It was indeed a strange group that Swamiji had gatheredround him at Thousand Island Park. Not many of them hadattended all or even any of his classes at New York \u2014 not the1001two Detroit ladies, not also Landsberg who had attended themfor a short while only. Yet how most of them were rooted totheir seats for days and nights together as he poured forth atorrent of thoughts on philosophy, religion, and what not, that,as we find them collected in the Inspired Talks , 62 seem to bebeyond the grasp of the most finished scholars! About that weshall speak presently, but first let us see what the lucky groupwas like. Sister Christine has given us names and briefdescriptions of nine of them. 63 There were the three friendswho had come to the Vedanta classes together \u2014 S.E. Waldo,whom sister Devamata, who knew her in the Vedanta classes,describes as a \u201ctall, portly, figure, who moved about doingeverything\u201d, (in the days of those classes at New York); \u201ctheexcellent little old man\u201d (he was over seventy), Dr. Wight; and\u201chis sweet and modest Antigone, Miss Ruth Ellis\u201d (as RomainRolland describes them). Mrs. Funke said about them, \u201cIespecially like Miss Waldo and Miss Ellis, although the wholehousehold is interesting\u201d. Ruth Ellis, we learn from SisterChristine, was on the staff of one of New York newspapers.She was gentle and retiring and seldom spoke, yet one knewher love and devotion were unbounded. Dr. Wight, a verylearned man from Cambridge, often provided much amusement.He became so absorbed in the teaching that, invariably, at theend of a lecture, he went up to Swamiji asking, \u201cWell, Swami,it all amounts to this in the end, doesn\u2019t it? I am Brahman, Iam the Absolute\u201d. \u201cYes, Docky,\u201d Swamiji would answer him,with an indulgent smile, \u201cyou are Brahman, you are theAbsolute, in the real essence of your being\u201d. Later, when \u201clittleold Docky Wight\u201d, as they all called him, came a little late,Swamiji, with the utmost gravity but with a merry twinkle inhis eyes, would say, \u201cHere comes Brahman\u201d, or \u201cHere is theAbsolute\u201d.SWAMIJI AT THOUSAND ISLAND PARKSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1002Mrs. Funke was a charming young woman, who gaveher whole soul to her Teacher, whom each pupil took in his orher own way. While everybody in the classes would be busytaking down notes, she would find herself lost in listening tohim, losing herself in the divine music of his voice. Sometimesshe would ask him some \u201cdaring questions\u201d \u2014 \u201drushing in\u201d,as she explains herself, \u201cwhere angels fear to tread\u201d. 64 He tookher impulsiveness kindly and once, referring to this, said tosomeone, \u201cMrs. Funke rests me, she is no na\u00efve\u201d. Perhaps morethan many others, she realized how much Swamiji needed restand relaxation. The body and mind, she felt, should not bekept at so great a tension all the time. While others were afraidof losing a word, she thought how she could amuse him.65 Sheasked Swamiji to accept her for his work in India, as he hadaccepted her friend, Christine. Swamiji said, \u201cYou are ahouseholder. Go back to Detroit, and find God in your husbandand family. That is your path at present\u201d. In her old age, whenhealth was failing and she suffered from various physicaldisabilities, nothing rekindled the flame and brought the fireof enthusiasm to such a glow as conversation about Swamiji.For her, he still lived; she actually felt his presence \u2014 a blessedexperience. She was confident that at her last moment she wouldfind the darkness illumined and in that luminous atmosphere\u201ca radiant presence\u201d would give her that great gift  \u2014 Freedom.The Swami\u2019s choice of two others, Marie Louise andLeon Landsberg, says Sister Christine, grew out of the theorywhich he then held that fanaticism is power gone astray. If thisforce can be transmuted and turned into a higher channel, itbecomes a great power for good. In Marie Louise and LeonLandsberg Swamiji saw this quality. Marie Louise was aFrenchwoman but naturalized and twenty-five years a residentof New York. She was long known in liberal circles as a1003materialist, socialist. With her short wiry hair and masculinefeatures \u2014 large bones, a heavy voice \u2014 and dressed like malesin India \u2014 this tall, fifty-year old woman was so masculine inappearance, says Sister Christine, that \u201cone looked twice beforeone could tell whether she was a man or a woman\u201d. Her path,she announced, was that of philosophy  \u2014 jnana . Along withLandsberg, she  was initiated into sannyasa by Swamiji, andrenamed Swami Abhayananda, but she left Thousand IslandPark before the classes had ended and soon afterwardsorganized a centre of Vedanta in California and, later, one inWashington. The fanatic element in Landsberg had been noticedby Swamiji even in their first chance meeting, which was at aTheosophical gathering, where Landsberg was giving a lectureon \u201cThe Devil\u201d. Just in front of him, there sat a woman wearinga scarlet blouse, and now and then, as Landsberg said the word\u201cdevil\u201d he invariably pointed a finger at her direction. At hisinitiation he received the name, Swami Kripananda,compassion being his most outstanding attribute. 66Of the two remaining Thousand Island Park discipleswhom Sister Christine wrote about, one feels that they werepathetic figures, each being such in her own way. Stella excitedthe curiosity of her fellow disciples because she generally keptherself secluded in a room in the ground floor, where she lived.She seldom came up to the classes, being too deeply engrossedin ascetic practices (as others were given to understand) tobreak in upon them. On enquiry they learned that she had beenan actress and that she had taken to Raja Yoga as a way toregain her fading beauty and lost youth. Whether Swamijiunderstood this or not, he helped her in his own way and gaveher as her Ishta (chosen ideal) Gopala (the baby Krishna). Oneday he said about her in his class, \u201cI like that baby. She is soartless\u201d. This met with a dead silence, and instantly his wholeSWAMIJI AT THOUSAND ISLAND PARKSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1004manner changed, and he said very gravely, \u201cI call her Babyhoping it will make her childlike, free from art and guile\u201d.After the classes were disbanded Stella went to live on a smallisland in Orchard Lake \u2014 building there a tiny one roomedcottage and living alone. She wore a turban and practicedYoga \u2014 which was commonly believed to be somethingmysterious  and occult associated with India. Newspaper menvisited her, and one won a momentary fame by writing a storyof a young woman practising yoga on an island not far away.Stella went back to live the ordinary life, and none of her fellowdisciples knew anything of her afterwards until they receivedthe news of her death some time in 1945.Miss Dutcher, the hostess of the group of disciples andof the Teacher, was a conscientious little woman and a devoutMethodist. How she, aged 63 and bound by conventions andorthodoxy, came to have such a regard for Swami Vivekananda,a breaker of all fetters, was something that the others werepuzzled about. As she listened to Swamiji\u2019s lectures, all herideals, her values of life, her concepts of religion were, it seemedto her, destroyed. In reality, they were only modified.Sometimes, she absented herself for two or three days fromthe classes on the ground of illness. Swamiji correctly diagnosedher state and once remarked, \u201cDon\u2019t you see, this is not anordinary illness? It is the reaction of the body against the chaosthat is going on in her mind. She cannot bear it\u201d. He persistedwith his treatment and, as one day (13 July), while exposingthe claim of free will, he remarked, \u201cThe idea of duty is themidday sun of misery scorching the very soul,\u201d the Methodistin her revolted. \u201cIs it not our duty,\u201d she began, but got no farther.After this, Miss Dutcher was not seen for some days. It is onlywhen one\u2019s devotion to one\u2019s guru is unbounded, commentsSister Christine on this episode, that, like the snake, one drops1005the old and puts on the new. Otherwise, she goes on to say, theeffect of truth is devastating. We may mention that on this daySwamiji was explaining what real freedom is like and saidfurther, \u201cThe free can be only one, the Unconditioned, theInfinite, the Unlimited. . Work from your own free will, notfrom duty. This world is a gymnasium in which we play; ourlife is an eternal holiday\u201d. 67From the accounts of Miss Waldo and others we get anidea of the daily round of work at Thousand Island Park. \u201cEverymorning,\u201d says Miss Waldo, \u201cjust as soon as our various taskswere over, the Swami called us together in the large parlourthat served as a classroom and began to teach us. Each day hetook up some special subject, or expounded from some sacredbook, as the Bhagavad-Gita , the Upanishads, or the VedantaSutras of Vyasa. . Sometimes the Swami took up the BhaktiSutras of Narada. . In these talks the Swami for the first timespoke to us at great length about his great Master,Sri Ramakrishna.\u201d68 \u201cIn the afternoons he talked to us moreinformally, and we took usually a long walk.\u201d69 About thesewalks we learn a little more from Mrs. Funke\u2019s narration. \u201cWetake long walks every afternoon, and our favourite walk is backof the cottage down a hill and then a rustic path to the river. .Sometimes we stop several times and sit around on the grassand listen to Swami\u2019s wonderful talks. A bird, a flower, abutterfly, will start him off, and he will tell us stories from theVedas, or recite Indian poetry.\u201d 70 \u201cEvery evening\u201d, Miss Waldotells us \u201cwe adjourned to an upstairs piazza that commanded aglorious view over the waters and islands of the broad river..We were along with nature, and it was a fitting scene in whichto listen to the utterances of such a Teacher. The Swami didnot appear to address us directly, but rather seemed to bespeaking to himself in words of fire, as it were, so intense wereSWAMIJI AT THOUSAND ISLAND PARKSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1006they, so eloquent and convincing, burning into the very heartsof his listeners never to be forgotten. We listened in utter silence,almost holding our breath for fear of disturbing the current ofhis thoughts, or losing one of those inspired words\u201d. 71It was not always a one-sided affair at these eveningmeetings, as we learn from Sister Christine, for the Swami,one of whose objects was to train these American pupils of hisin propagating Vedanta in their country, would often call uponthem to make speeches. (Later, at Belur Math also, he trainedhis disciples to be speakers by methods similar to what headopted with regard to these American disciples.) \u201cIt was atrying ordeal,\u201d says Sister Christine, \u201cEach in turn was calledupon to make an attempt. There was no escape. Perhaps thatwas why certain of our group failed to make an appearance atthese intimate evening gatherings, although they knew that oftenhe soared to the greatest heights as the night advanced. What ifit was two o\u2019clock in the morning? What if we had watchedthe moon rise and set? Time and space had vanished\u201d. 72 Abouttheir forgetfulness of time, Miss Waldo has said, \u201cHe alwaysspent two hours with us and more often much longer. Oneglorious night, when the moon was about full, he talked to usuntil she set below the horizon, apparently as unconscious aswe were of the lapse of time\u201d. 73 \u201cThere was nothing set orformal about these nights on the veranda,\u201d Sister Christine goeson to say. \u201cHe sat in his large chair at the end, near the door.Sometimes he went into a deep meditation. At such times wetoo meditated, or sat in profound silence. Often it lasted forhours and one after the other slipped away. For we knew thatafter this he would not feel inclined to speak. Or again themeditation would be short, and he would encourage us to askquestions afterwards, often calling one of us to answer. Nomatter how far wrong these answers were, he let us flounder1007about until we were near the truth, and then in a few words, hewould clear up the difficulty. .\u201d 74The original plan, Sister Christine tells us, was that theyshould live as a community, without servants, each doing ashare of the work. It did not succeed, since nearly all of themwere unaccustomed to household work, and it threatened tobecome disastrous. With Swamiji the effect was quite different.Though only one among them all was younger than himself,he seemed like a father or mother in patience. When the tensionbecame too great, he would offer to cook for all of them, anddid so sometimes. Landsberg objected, recalling his experienceof Swamiji cooking in their joint establishment at New York.\u201cHeaven save us,\u201d he would ejaculate in an aside. He explainedthat on days when Swamiji cooked at New York, he, Landsberg,would tear his hair, because it meant for him an additionallabour of washing every dish in the house. Since childhoodSwamiji had practised cooking and he was now an expert inthe art. About the meals he prepared at Thousand Island Park,Mrs. Funke has said, \u201cThe food he prepares is delicious butfor `yours truly\u2019 too hot with various spices; but I made up mymind to eat it if it strangled me, which it nearly did. If aVivekananda can cook for me, I guess the least I can do is toeat it\u201d. 75 In a letter to Mary Hale from London on 30 May1896, Swamiji gave the following certificate to a dish preparedby himself. \u201cLast night I made a dish. It was such a deliciousmixture of saffron, lavender, mace, nutmeg, cubebs, cinnamon,cloves, cardamom, cream, lime juice, onions, raisins, almonds,pepper and rice, that I myself could not eat it. There was noasafoetida, though that would have made it smoother toswallow\u201d. 76SWAMIJI AT THOUSAND ISLAND PARKSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1008We shall presently take up the substance of the teachingat Thousand Island Park, which occupied the major portion oftheir high-tension life. It had a lighter side, which it is necessaryfor us to dwell on a little, since it helps us to understand howthat life was at all bearable. Swamiji appeared before hisdisciples not only as the Teacher of the highest knowledge,Brahmavidya, not only also as the embodiment of Power, Sakti,but as their  loving father, or brother, or a playful companion.In their hours with them when he was occupied with otherthan teaching work, he would tell them amusing stories,becoming once again the boy Naren, who, as we know, narratedto his younger brother Mahendra, night after night, before goingto sleep, fables that he had been told by his mother andgrandmother. In slightly graver mood he would tell them abouthis early life, his parents, and in more serious mood, but stilldivertingly, about Sri Ramakrishna, Buddha, the great heroinesof the epics, Sita and Savitri, as also of Kalidasa\u2019s works, suchas Sakuntala, and Uma, as also many others. Often too, hewould become the playful child, delighting in fun andfrivolity \u2014 sometimes, striking them all with his wonderfulpower of detachment, \u2014 passing on to this state immediatelyafter he had been expounding the loftiest philosophy.He had a stock of funny stories, which he narrated againand again without sounding monotonous. One was about amissionary to a cannibal island, who, upon his arrival, askedthe people there how they had liked his predecessor, andreceived the answer, \u201cDelicious\u201d. Another was about a \u201cdarky\u201dpreacher, which he narrated, pronunciation, intonation, andlanguage intact. The preacher was shouting out, \u201cYou see, Godwas making Adam, and he was a making him out o\u2019mud. Andwhen he had him made, he stucks him up again a fence to dry.And then \u2014\u201d. \u201cHold on, there, preacher,\u201d suddenly cried out a1009learned listener. \u201cWhat about that fence? Who made thatfence?\u201d The preacher replied sharply, \u201cNow you listen here,Sam Jones. Don\u2019t you be a ginning to ask such ere question.Youse\u2019ll ere smash up all theology\u201d. Another day he told themabout a husband and wife who lived by making ghosts. When,he said, he had remonstrated with the husband, and tried topersuade him to give up deceiving people, saying, \u201cYou oughtnot to do this\u201d, the wife came up behind, and said eagerly,\u201cYes, sir. That\u2019s what I tell him; for he makes all the ghosts,and Mrs. Williams takes all the money\u201d. As we have said above,he often cooked at Thousand Island Park, and then he alsodelighted in serving the \u201cbrithrin\u201d. \u201cAt such times,\u201d saysMrs. Funke, \u201cWe were in a whirlwind of fun. Swamiji willstand on the floor with a white napkin draped over his arm, ala the waiters on the dining cars, and will intone in perfectimitation their call for dinner \u2014 `Last call of\u2019 the dinning cah.Dinner served\u201d. \u2014 Irresistibly funny! And then, at table, suchgales of laughter over some quip or jest, for he unfailinglydiscovers the little idiosyncrasies of each one \u2014 but neversarcasm or malice \u2014 just fun\u201d 77Diversions such as the above were necessary also forthe Swami, who was often under a severe strain. His friendsand disciples \u2014 specially those who knew whatSri Ramakrishna had said about him (that he would leave hisbody when he knew his real nature) \u2014 were happy when theyfound him in his lighter moods. Of late, at times, to their alarm,he was letting drop such words as, \u201cOh, the body is a terriblebondage!\u201d In a letter to Mrs. Bull, referred to by us above, hesaid, \u201cIt appears like a hallucination that I was in these childishdreams of doing this and doing that. I am getting out of them\u201d.It was at such moments also that he wrote his poems, \u201cMyPlay is Done\u201d and \u201cThe Song of the Sannyasin\u201d. His body tooSWAMIJI AT THOUSAND ISLAND PARKSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1010was, as we have said many times above, showing alarmingsymptoms of its inability to stand the strain it was put to. Oftenafter he had made a long railway journey it seemed for days asthough the wheels of the trains revolved with their noise in thebrain. His head was always clear but he was frequently sufferingfrom insomnia, and he was growing exceedingly nervous. Hisfriends could not but see the cost to the body with which hisspiritual message was given. Though he was himselfunconscious that the body was sinking and worked still harder,his friends could clearly see that he was sacrificing himself fortheir good and for humanity.Often, when he was staying as a guest at the house of afriend or a disciple, his indifference to etiquette shockedWestern susceptibilities, but they tolerated it, nay were gladthat he felt himself perfectly at home and was happy. Whenthey prepared some delicious recipe for him, it would fill themwith delight to see his eyes beaming with joy like those of achild, and then eat with his fingers as Indians do, and said heenjoyed it more in that way. It amused them when, in the privacyof their homes, he would throw off his collar and boots, andslip his feet in a pair of house slippers; and as to cuffs, theywere an abomination in his eyes. If he asked to be allowed tocook an Indian dish himself, they would immediately agree,and also offer to help him in doing it \u2014 for, thus, time wouldpass by in merriment. On such occasions, he would first takeout of his pockets quite a number of small packets filled withfinely ground condiments and spices that had been sent to himfrom India, and were often too hot for Western palates. Hewould often take a lot of time in making the dishes so thatwhen they were ready, everybody was hungry and hunger isthe best sauce. There would be laughter and merry talk, and he1011would be delighted in seeing how the Western tongue stoodthe hot spiced dishes of his country.His women disciples, who were used to the attentionsthat were conventionally paid by men to women in Westernsociety, were at first shocked at Swamiji\u2019s \u201clapses\u201d in thisregard. \u201cHe,\u201d says Sister Christine, \u201cin the days when men didnot smoke before ladies, would approach, and blow the cigarettesmoke deliberately into one\u2019s face\u201d. Her reaction is best givenin her own words. \u201cHad it been anyone else, I should haveturned my back and not spoken to him again. Even so for amoment I recoiled. I caught myself and remembered the reasonfor coming. I had come to one in whom I had seen suchspirituality as I had never even dreamed of. From his lips I hadheard truths un-thought of before. He knew the way toattainment. He would show me the way. Did I intend to let alittle whiff of smoke turn me back? It was all over in less timethan it takes to tell it\u201d. In a few more days with the Swami, thegood young woman found that there was some meaning in theSwami\u2019s apparent unmannerliness and that he had a muchhigher conception of respect for women than westerners. \u201cWewere allowed to climb up and slide down the rocks,\u201d she goeson to say, \u201cwithout an extended arm to help us. When he sensedour feeling, he answered, as he often did, our unspoken thought.`If you were old, or weak, or helpless, I should help you. Butyou are quite able to jump across this brook, or climb this pathwithout help. You are as able as I am. Why should I help you?Because you are a woman? That is chivalry, and don\u2019t you seethat chivalry is only sex? Don\u2019t you see what is behind theseattentions from men to women? Strange, as it may seem, withthese words came a new idea of what true reverence forwomanhood means\u201d. 78INSPIRED TALKSSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1012So, for his western women friends and disciples,Swamiji\u2019s defiance of social etiquette and demand for freedomfor himself, were not always something that was just to betolerated, or conceded, but to be learned from. In any case, itmade him all the dearer to them, for they revealed to them hishuman qualities, an aspect not uppermost when he talkedVedanta with them. Above all, they recognized, as we havementioned above, his need for recreation and let him have hisway. A certain lady, who was well-known for her love of bossingover others, would be irritated for the time being by his defianceof the plans and arrangements that she had made for him, butwould soon burst out laughing and say lovingly, \u201cAt the lastmoment he upsets  all my plans for him. He must have his ownway. He is just like a mad bull in a china shop.\u201d Often also, weare told, his friends were amply rewarded for allowing Swamijito indulge in frivolities such as \u201ctalking nonsense\u201d, for whoknew when on a sudden he would pass from fun to holiness?The fact is that Swamiji \u201cwas actually possessed of dualconsciousness. Whilst he might be playing, as it were, on thesurface of his personality, one was made aware at the samemoment of the mighty flow of the ponderous depths beneath\u201d.79There were people in the West who misunderstoodSwamiji because when they met him he happened to be in arelaxed, or a gay mood. He was perhaps found reading an issueof the \u201cPunch\u201d or some other comic paper and laughing andlaughing till the tears rolled from his eyes. Or perhaps he wasnoticed spending his mornings and evenings in nothing butreading some paper from cover to cover. Unthinking westernerswere betrayed into thinking lightly of him, specially becausetheir idea of a holy man, as we have said in a previous Chapter,was different. The story is told of a disciple who could notunderstand him at first, being unfortunately in his presence1013only in his times of recreation, and who was one day suddenlymade conscious of the Swami\u2019s true nature. One day he askedhim a question concerning religion, and he was astounded tosee that the face of the Swami, who a moment previously wasin a merry mood, changed instantly. Fun gave place to therevelation of the highest religious truths. The man says, \u201cItseemed as though the Master had of a sudden cast aside thelayer of that consciousness in which he had been then enjoyinghimself and made me aware of other layers behind the networkof changing personality\u201d. 80 Swamiji could as readily pass fromfun to spirituality as the other way, from spirituality to trifle.We read the following story in Miss Josephine MacLeod\u2019sreminiscences of him.\u201d Swami  lectured a great number of timesat the Home of Truth and in various halls, but perhaps the mostoutstanding lecture I ever heard was his talk of `Jesus ofNazareth\u2019, when he seemed to radiate a white light from headto foot, so lost was he in the wonder and power of Christ. I wasso impressed with this obvious halo that I did not speak to himon the way back for fear of interrupting, as I thought, the greatthoughts that were still in his mind. Suddenly he said to me, `Iknow how it is done\u2019. I said, `How what is done?\u2019 `How theymake mulligatawny soup! They put a bay leaf in it,\u2019 he toldme. That utter lack of self-consciousness, of self-importance,was perhaps one of his outstanding characteristics\u201d. 81IVThe same lack of self-consciousness, of self-importancecharacterized Swamiji\u2019s life at Thousand Island Park. The sevenweeks that he spent there were certainly one of the freest andthe greatest periods of his life. 82 He was living in an atmospheresimilar to that in which Sri Ramakrishna had lived and taughtin the Dakshineswar days of old. The whirlwind of spiritualINSPIRED TALKSSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1014rhapsody and ecstasy that swept the souls of the devotees atDakshineswar on the banks of the holy Ganga, swept here anewthe souls of other devotees in the island retreat on the beautifulSt. Lawrence river. 83 He later reckoned his experience as oneof the most exalted in his life, but at the time spoke about it tonone. In his letters of the period, he spoke very modestly aboutthe work he was doing at Thousand Island Park. As we haveseen, in a letter to Mrs. Bull on 25 April 1895, he had said thathe had planned to go to Thousand Island Park with a view tomanufacturing a few Yogis out of his Vedanta classes in NewYork. But on 7 June 1895 he wrote to her, \u201cI will meditate bythe hour there and be all alone to myself\u201d. 84 After he had beena few days at that place constantly in the company of his pupilsand putting their souls on fire, he wrote to Mary Hale about hisexperience as follows, \u201cNothing noticeable has happenedduring this visit to the Thousand Islands. The scenery is verybeautiful and I have some friends here with me to talk aboutGod and soul ad libitum. I am eating fruits and drinking milkand so forth, and studying huge Sanskrit books on Vedantawhich they have kindly sent me from India\u201d. 85From his next letter to Mary Hale, however, we have aninkling of the state of his mind at this time. \u201cI am enjoying thisplace immensely,\u201d says he. \u201cVery little eating and a good dealof thinking and talking and study. A wonderful calmness iscoming over my soul. Every day I feel I have no duty to do; Iam always in eternal rest and peace. It is He that works. We areonly the instruments. Blessed be His name! The threefoldbondage of lust and gold and fame is as it were fallen from mefor the time being, and once more, even here, I feel whatsometimes I felt in India. `From me all difference has fallen,all right or wrong, all delusion and ignorance has vanished, Iam walking in the path beyond the qualities\u2019. What law I obey,1015what disobey? From that height the universe looks like a mudpuddle. Hari Om Tat Sat. He exists, nothing else does. I am inThee and Thou in me. Be Thou my eternal refuge! Peace, Peace,Peace!\u201d 86 This letter, it may be noted, is undated, but one mayguess that it was written not long before the day when, as weknow and shall speak more about again presently, he was foundlost in nirvikalpa samadhi on the bank of the St. Lawrence. Ina letter to Mrs. Sturges written in July, 1895 (precise date notgiven), he referred to his life at Thousand Island Park as follows,\u201cAll the sleep of the world has come upon me. . . I am alsowriting and reading a little, and have a class every morningafter breakfast.  The meals are being conducted on the strictestvegetarian principles, and I am fasting a good deal\u201d. 87In his letters from Thousand Island Park that we havequoted from above, Swamiji says that he was reading hugeSanskrit works on the Vedanta and also writing a little. Welearn from a letter that Swamiji wrote to Mrs. Bull as far backas May, 1895 (precise date not known), while he was fullyengaged in his work at the Vedanta classes, that at ThousandIsland Park he planned to write a book in English on the Vedantaphilosophy \u201cin its three stages\u201d. 88 By the time he had reachedthat place, the three Bhashyas had reached him and, as we shallsee presently, his utterances there were, as it were, so manycommentaries on them, though they were remarkably originalin their expression. 89 It does not seem, however, that he wasable to write anything there besides the few letters to hisAmerican friends and the still fewer ones to his disciples inIndia. As regards the letters last mentioned, we find one writtento Alasinga on 1 July 1895, which has a reference to renewedattacks on him by the Christian missionaries in India, includinghis \u201ccountryman\u201d, the Rev. Hume, \u2014 this time charging himwith eating unorthodox food in American hotels. 90INSPIRED TALKSSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1016Swamiji treated this particular attack with contempt andlater, in a letter to Alasinga from Paris, dated 9 September 1895,gave a smashing reply. Finally to dispose of the matter, therelevant portion of this letter may be quoted here. \u201cI amsurprised you take so seriously the missionaries\u2019 nonsense. Ofcourse I eat everything. 91 If the people in India want me tokeep strictly to my Hindu diet, please tell them to send me acook and money enough to keep him. This silly bossism withouta mite of real help makes me laugh. On the other hand, if themissionaries tell you that I have ever broken the two great vowsof chastity and poverty \u2014 tell them that they are big liars.Please write to  the missionary Hume asking him categoricallyto write you what misdemeanors he saw in me or give the namesof his informants, and whether information was firsthand ornot; that will settle the question and expose the whole thing.\u2026.Do you mean to say I am born to live and die one of thosecaste ridden, superstitious, merciless, hypocritical, atheisticcowards that you find only amongst the educated Hindus? Ihate cowardice; I will have nothing to do with cowards orpolitical nonsense. I do not believe in any politics. God andtruth are the only politics in the world, everything else is trash\u201d.God and truth were indeed the theme of all his talks atThousand Island Park, some idea of which we shall attempt togive here. Some of the pupils took down notes of the lectures,but few succeeded in their exercise so well that they thoughtthey were worthy of publication. Mrs. Funke has spoken ofher own attempt to do so as follows, \u201cWe are trying to takenotes of all that he says but I find myself lost in listening andforget the notes\u201d. 92 Only Miss Waldo who, during many yearsof attendance at lectures, had acquired the art of summarizinga whole lecture in a few words and had successfully taken downSwamiji\u2019s dictations on Raja Yoga, tolerably succeeded in the1017effort. In a sort of a diary she summarized the talks from day today, mostly in Swamiji\u2019s own words, certainly missing much,but happily being able to take down quite a lot of what theMaster said in his hours of loftiest flights in the realm of thespirit. They were later published in book form, under theappropriate title, Inspired Talks, and are included in Vol. VIIof the Complete Works, where they cover about one hundredpages. 93 Many of the elevating ideas of Swamiji that are foundthere are to be found in other works also, such as the KarmaYoga, the Jnana Yoga, and the Bhakti Yoga, but here we have aunique assortment of ideas on diverse subjects, as wide in theirsweeps as thorough in their presentation.Swamiji took his pupils daily aloft on his mighty wings,and at bewildering speed, \u2014 making them survey the entireuniverse of the spirit in a way that a new vista was opened upbefore them almost every moment \u2014 few of which they hadeven dreamt of before, far less could think of as being withincomprehension. Sister Christine, who also has left us somerecord of the talks, though not, as Miss Waldo has done, in theform of a diary, but as a collection together with elucidation ofsome of the ideas, grouping them under headings, such assamadhi, God, non-injury, continence, austerity, freedom etc.,has the following to say about her own experiences of theclasses. \u201cIt seemed as if we had left the body and the bodilyconsciousness outside. We sat in a semicircle and waited. Whichgate to the Eternal would be opened for us today? Whatheavenly vision should meet our eyes? There was always thethrill of adventure. The undiscovered Country, the Sorrow lessLand opened up new vistas of hope and beauty. Even so ourexpectations were always exceeded. Vivekananda\u2019s flightscarried us to Supernal heights. Whatever degree of realizationmay or may not have come to us since, one thing we can neverINSPIRED TALKSSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1018forget. We saw the Promised Land. We, too, were taken to thetop of Pisgah (mountain from which Moses viewed thePromised Land) and the sorrow and trials of the world havenever been quite real since\u201d. 94The talks began on 19 June 1895, though by the timeonly three or four of the pupils had arrived, so eager was theSwami to begin his work, and on this the first day he camewith the Bible in his hand. He opened to the Book of John,saying that since all were Christians, it was proper that he shouldbegin with the Christian scriptures. He began the talks withthe quotation, \u201cIn the beginning was the Word, and the Wordwas with God\u201d. He said, \u201cThe Hindu calls this Maya, themanifestation of God, because it is the power of God. TheAbsolute reflecting through the universe is what we call nature\u201d.He thus began with a statement of the realization that had oncecome upon him a few years ago during his days of wanderingin the Himalayas while meditating under an aged Peepul treestanding on the bank of a stream near Almora. In a note book,the Swami had then written some lines, which, in translation,are reproduced in The Life, and give us a glimpse of the trendof his thoughts and realization. 95 In the course of his talk onthis day, Swamiji went on to say, \u201cThe Absolute cannot beknown; we cannot know the Father, only the Son\u2026 Mattergets its whole existence from the presence of the mind behindit. What we see is God percolating through nature\u201d. The greattruth which is proclaimed in the Upanishads, e.g., in the veryfirst line of the Isa, \u2014 Isavasyam idam sarvam \u2014  (all this isthe habitation of the Lord) \u2014 signifying the identity betweenGod and the universe, must have, as thus at the very outsetimpressed upon the minds of his disciples by Swamiji, openedtheir minds to the reception of the inspiring thoughts that he1019was now to pour out before them day after day at ThousandIsland Park.In his Vedanta classes Swamiji had lectured mostly, ormainly upon Raja Yoga, and he does not seem to have enteredinto philosophical discussions as such. At Thousand Island Parkhe dealt with other paths to realization  \u2014 Karma, Jnana, andBhakti,  \u2014 besides Raja , and dwelt on all systems of Hinduphilosophy, specially Vedanta, as expounded in the threeschools of Dvaita, Visishtadvaita, and Advaita, headedrespectively by Madhva, Ramanuja and Sankara. All the greatreligious teachers of the world, such as Buddha, Christ, Krishna,and their teachings received respectful treatment from him.He spoke to his disciples,  for the first time at great length, onhis great Master, Sri Ramakrishna, on his own struggles withand final surrender to him \u201cafter an experience of which henever spoke, it being too sacred,\u201d as Sister Christine tells us. 96On certain days he would come to the class with a book in hishand \u2014 such as the Bible, or the Gita, or the Bhakti Sutras ofNarada, or the Yoga Aphorisms of Patanjali, or the AvadhutaGita of Dattatreya, or some one of the Upanishads (such asKatha, or Brihadaranyaka), besides the commentaries onVedanta. He would begin with reading from the texts, expoundthem, and then plunge deep into lofty thoughts that underlaythem. He gave elaborate discourses on all the three greatcommentaries on the Vedanta, showing how each twisted themeaning of the Sutras to meet its particular point of view, andpointing out incidentally how old was the habit of \u201ctexttorturing\u201d. \u201cMost frequently, however,\u201d says Miss Waldo, \u201cthecommentary of Sankara was taken up; but because of its subtletyhe was more difficult to understand, so to the end Ramanujaremained the favourite among the students\u201d. 97 Swamiji gaveeveryone perfect freedom to develop spirituality in his or herSWAMIJI\u2019S PHILOSOPHYSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1020own way, for though his philosophy (Advaita) was substantiallythe same as Sankara\u2019s, he, like his own Master, did not confinehimself to one system, and did not desire that his pupils shoulddo otherwise.It is not an easy task to give the reader even a rough ideaof Swamiji\u2019s philosophy, which he never presented in asystematized form, and can be gathered only by a thoroughstudy of all his relevant writings and utterances. Scholars whohave performed this task differ in their interpretations ofSwamiji\u2019s philosophical views. 98 What has puzzled many isthe fact that though an upholder and expounder of AdvaitaVedanta, which holds that Brahma alone is real, all else unreal( Brahma satyam jaganmithya), he dedicated his life to theservice of humanity.  An undeniable fact is that in him thebrain of a Sankara was found united with the heart of a Buddha.How that became possible has been sought to be explained invarious ways. One may safely say, however, that he not onlyrepresented this union in his own personality, but advocated itas the highest philosophy. In one of his lectures on Jnana Yoga,Swamiji observed as follows, \u201cIn Buddha we had the great,universal heart and infinite patience, making religion practicaland bringing it to every man\u2019s door. In Sankaracharya we sawtremendous intellectual power, throwing the scorching lightof reason upon everything. We want today that bright sun ofintellectuality, joined with the heart of Buddha, the wonderfulinfinite heart of love and mercy. This union will give us thehighest philosophy\u201d. 99 He worked out that philosophy on thelines, let us remember, that had been laid out by his great Master,Sri Ramakrishna, preached and lived it. In this philosophy,unlike in Sankara\u2019s (in which also the world is given a sort ofreality, though from a lower standpoint of our practical lifeand experience), what is sought to be taught is not the1021annihilation of the world but its deification. In his very firsttalk at Thousand Island Park, Swamiji, as we have seen,proclaimed this deification, and he elaborated on this idea andits implications in many of his succeeding talks.Swamiji never claimed that he inculcated a new systemof philosophy, and, as we have said above, he was indebtedheavily to Sri Ramakrishna for his leading ideas, but the wayhe interpreted them was original, and they became his own.The task of presenting them, specially to westerners and in awestern tongue, was a formidable one, and he accomplished italso in his own and original way. As we have seen, he equippedhimself for it by hard and prolonged study of Sanskrit workson Indian philosophy, specially Vedanta in all its threeinterpretations. But the presentation was not the product ofmere scholarship, it came out of his realization, which wasborn of austerities and prolonged meditations. In a letter toAlasinga, dated 17 February 1896, Swamiji gave an idea ofthe difficulties he had to face in performing his task. Said he,\u201cTo put the Hindu ideas into English and then make out of dryphilosophy and intricate mythology and queer startlingpsychology, a religion which shall be easy, simple, popular,and at the same time meet the requirements of the highestminds \u2014 is a task only those can understand who haveattempted it. The abstract Advaita must become living \u2014 poetic \u2014 in everyday life; out of hopelessly intricatemythology must come concrete moral forms; and out ofbewildering Yogiism must come the most scientific andpractical psychology \u2014 and all this must be put in a form thata child may grasp it. That is my life\u2019s work. The Lord onlyknows how far I shall succeed. `To work we have the right, notto the fruits thereof\u2019. It is hard work, my boy, hard work. Tokeep one\u2019s own self steady in the midst of this whirl of KamaINSPIRED TALKSSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1022Kanchana (lust and gold) and hold on to one\u2019s own ideals,until disciples are moulded to conceive of the ideas ofrealization and perfect renunciation, is indeed difficult work,my boy. Thank God, already there is great success\u201d. 100Anyone who would attempt to summarize in his ownway the teachings at Thousand Island Park is likely to run therisk of going altogether out of his depth. Even the great authorsof The Life have restricted themselves, while endeavouring todo so, to giving some extracts from the Inspired Talks. We aredoing the same here, a little more extensively.\u201cEvil is the iron chain, good is the gold one; both arechains. Be free, and know once for all that there is no chain foryou\u201d.\u201cBe brave and be sincere; then follow any path withdevotion and you must reach the Whole. Once lay hold of onelink of the chain and the whole chain must come by degrees.Water the roots of the tree (that is, the Lord), and the wholetree is watered; getting the Lord we get all\u2026\u2026Look at the`ocean\u2019 and not at the `wave\u2019; see no difference between antand angel. Every worm is the brother of the Nazarene\u2026. Weare in the sun and in the stars as much as here\u2026. We aremagicians waving magic wands and creating scenes before usat will. We are the spider in his huge web, who can go on thevaried strands whosesoever he desires. The spider is nowconscious only of the spot where he is, but he will in time beconscious of the whole web\u201d.\u201cIn time to come Christs will be in numbers like bunchesof grapes on a vine; then the play will be over and will pass out\u2014 as water in a kettle beginning to boil shows first one bubble,then another, then more and more until all is ebullition and1023passes out as Steam. Buddha and Christ are the two biggest\u201cbubbles\u201d the world has yet produced. Moses was a tiny bubble,greater and greater ones came. Some time, however, all willbe bubbles and escape; but creation, ever new, will bring newwater to go through the process over again\u201d.\u201cLove is of three kinds \u2014 one demands but givesnothing; the second is exchange; and the third is love withoutthought of return \u2014 love like that of the moth for thelight\u2026.Love is higher than works, than Yoga, than knowledge\u201d.\u201cAfter every happiness comes misery; they may be farapart or near. The more advanced the soul, the more quicklydoes the one follow the other\u2026 These are states , and statesmust ever change, but the nature of the Soul is bliss, peace,unchanging\u201d.\u201cThe pleasure of the Self is what the world calls religion\u201d.\u201cChildren finding glass beads in a mud puddle, that isthe good of the World\u201d.\u201cWe have nothing to do but stand aside and let God work.The more we go away, the more God comes in\u201d. \u201cWe have lost ourselves, and then think the world islost\u201d.\u201cThe Light Divine within is obscured in most people. Itis like a lamp in a cask of iron, no gleam of light can shinethrough. Gradually, by purity and unselfishness we can makethe obscuring medium less and less dense, until it becomes astransparent as glass. Sri Ramakrishna was like the iron casktransformed into a glass cask, through which can be seen theINSPIRED TALKSSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1024inner light as it is. We are all on the way to become the cask ofglass and even higher and higher reflections. As long as thereis a \u201ccask\u201d at all, we must think through material means. Noimpatient man can ever succeed\u201d.\u201cAs a character Buddha was the greatest the world hasever seen; next to him Christ. But the teachings of Krishna astaught by the Gita are the grandest the world has ever known\u2026.The human race will never again see such a brain as his whowrote the Gita\u201d.\u201cThe Divine Mother is the Kundalini (\u201ccoiled up\u201d power)sleeping in us; without worshipping her we can never knowourselves. All merciful, all-powerful, omnipresent are attributesof Divine Mother. She is the sum total of energy in the universe.Every manifestation of power in the universe is \u201cMother\u201d. Sheis life, She is intelligence, She is Love. She is in the universe,and yet separate from it. She is a person and can be seen andknown (as Sri Ramakrishna saw and knew Her). Establishedin the idea of Mother we can do anything. She quickly answersprayer\u201d.\u201cMan\u2019s knowledge is only a higher degree of bruteknowledge\u2026 We all know we are but not how we are\u201d.\u201cThe more we grow in love and virtue and holiness, themore we see love and virtue and holiness outside. Allcondemnation of others really condemns ourselves. Adjust themicrocosm (which is in your power to do) and the macrocosmwill adjust itself for you. It is like the hydrostatic paradox,only one drop of water can balance the universe. We cannotsee outside what we are not inside. The universe is to us whatthe huge engine is to the miniature engine; an indication of1025any error in the tiny engine leads us to imagine trouble in thehuge one\u201d.\u201cReligion without philosophy runs into superstition;philosophy without religion becomes dry atheism\u201d.\u201cWe are lamps, and the burning is what we call `life\u2019\u2026All we can do is to keep the lamp clean\u201d.\u201cRaja Yoga is the only science of religion that can bedemonstrated; and only what I myself have proved byexperience, do I teach\u201d.\u201cDis-identify yourself with the body, and all pain willcease. This is the secret of healing. The universe is a case ofhypnotization; dehypnotize yourself and cease to suffer\u201d. \u201cThe idea of duty is the midday sun of misery scorchingthe very soul\u2026 Work of your own free will, not from duty. Theworld is just a gymnasium in which we play; our life is aneternal holiday\u201d.\u201cModern science has really made the foundations ofreligion strong. That the whole universe is one is scientificallydemonstrable. What the metaphysicians call `being\u2019 thephysicians call `matter\u2019, but there is not real fight between thetwo. Though an atom is invisible, unthinkable, yet in it are thewhole power and potency of the universe. That is exactly whatthe Vedantist says of the Atman\u201d.\u201cPersonal God is the last generalization of the universe,only hazy, not clear cut and philosophic\u2026 Religion includesthe concrete, the more generalized and the ultimate unity. Donot stick to particularization. Get to the principle, to the One\u201d.INSPIRED TALKSSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1026\u201cThe Bhagavad-Gita is the best authority on Vedanta\u201d.\u201cBuddha was a great Vedantist (for Buddhism was reallyan offshoot of Vedanta), and Sankara is often called a `hiddenBuddhist\u2019\u2026 Buddha was the Washington of the religious world;he conquered a throne only to give it to the world, as Washingtondid to the American people. He sought nothing for himself\u201d.\u201cLook only for realization and choose the best methodyou can find to suit you. Eat the mangoes and let the rest quarrelover the basket. See Christ, then you will become a Christian.All else is talk; the less talking the better\u201d.\u201cGo into your own room and get the Upanishads out ofyour inner self. You are the greatest book that ever was or everwill be, the infinite depository of all that is. Until the innerteacher opens, all outside teaching is in vain, It must lead tothe opening of the book of the heart to have any value\u201d.\u201cIngersoll once said to me: `I believe in making the mostout of this world, in squeezing the orange dry, because thisworld is all we are sure of\u2019. I replied, `I know of a better wayto squeeze the orange of this world than you do, and I get moreout of it. I know I cannot die, so I am not in a hurry; I knowthere is no fear, so I enjoy the squeezing, I have no duty, nobondage of wife and children and property; I can love all menand women. Everyone is God to me. Think of the joy of lovingman as God! Squeeze the orange this way and get ten thousandfold more out of it. Get every single drop\u2019.\u201d\u201cWe are the greatest God that ever was or ever will be.Christs and Buddhas are but waves of the boundless oceanwhich  I am \u201c.1027\u201cThe whole of the Vedanta philosophy is in this story:Two birds of golden plumage sat on the same tree. The oneabove, serene, majestic, immersed in his own glory; the onebelow restless, and eating the fruits of the tree, now sweet,now bitter. Once he ate an exceptionally bitter fruit, then hepaused and looked at the majestic bird above; but he soon forgotabout the other bird and went on eating the fruits of the tree asbefore. Again he ate a bitter fruit and this time he hopped up afew boughs nearer to the bird at the top. This happened manytimes until at last the lower bird came to the place of the upperbird and lost himself. He found all at once that there had neverbeen two birds, but that he all the time was that upper bird,serene, majestic, and immersed in his own glory\u201d.\u201cGive up the burden of all deeds to the Lord; give all,both good and bad. Do not keep the good and give only thebad. God helps those who do not help themselves\u201d. \u201cReligion consists solely in realization. Doctrines aremethods, not religion. All the different religions are butapplications of the one religion adapted to suit the requirementsof different nations\u201d. \u201cHow can we understand that Moses saw God unlesswe too see Him? If God ever came to anyone He will come tome. I will go to God direct; let Him talk to me. I cannot takebelief as a basis that is atheism and blasphemy\u201d.\u201cOm tat sat\u2019 is the only thing beyond Maya, but Godexists eternally. As long as the Niagara Falls exists, the rainbowwill exist; but the universe and the rainbow is personal God,and both are eternal. While the universe exists, God must exist.God creates the universe, and the universe creates God; andboth are eternal. Maya is neither existence nor nonexistence.INSPIRED TALKSSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1028Both the Niagara Falls and the rainbow are eternallychangeable \u2014Brahman seen through Maya\u201d.It was while he was at Thousand Island Park that hecomposed what is regarded as his finest poem, The Song of theSannyasin. According to The Life, 101 it was composed in \u201ca stateof spiritual fervour and in protest to one who interfered withhis life, trying to dictate terms to him\u201d. The same work 102 givesanother version of the story of the composition of the poem, astold by Mrs. Funke. \u201cOne afternoon,\u201d Mrs. Funke is quoted assaying \u201cwhen he had been telling us of the glory of renunciation,of the joy and freedom of those of the ochre robe, he suddenlyleft us and in a short time he had written his `Song of theSannyasin\u2019, a very passion of sacrifice and renunciation\u201d. Inany case, the poem is in tune with the teachings at ThousandIsland Park, and besides throwing a light on Swamiji\u2019sphilosophy is a tribute to his literary talents. The Poem consistsof thirteen stanzas, each ending with the refrain, \u201cOm Tat Sat,Om.\u201d And is to be found in full in C.W. 103. We quote below thefollowing which give us an inkling of both his philosophy andthe fervour of spirit that inspired him to write the poem.Strike off thy fetter. Bonds that bind thee down,Of shining gold, or darker, baser ore,Love, hate \u2014 good, bad \u2014 and all the dual throng,Know, slave is slave, caressed or whipped, not free;For fetters though of gold, are not less strong to bind;Then off with them, Sannyasin bold!Say \u201cOm Tat Sat, Om\u201d.There is but One \u2014 The Free \u2014 The Knower \u2014 Self.Without a name, without a form or stain,In Him is Maya dreaming all this dream,1029The Witness, He appears as nature, soul.Know thou art That, Sannyasin bold!Say \u2014 \u201dOm Tat Sat, Om.\u201dFew only know the truth. The rest will hateAnd laugh at thee, great one; but pay no heed.Go thou, the free, from place to place, and helpThem out of darkness, Maya\u2019s veil. WithoutThe Fear of pain or search for pleasure, goBeyond them both, Sannyasin bold! \u2014 Say \u2014 \u201dOm Tat Sat, Om\u201d.Swamiji left Thousand Island Park on 7 August 1895. Itwas possibly on the same day that he had an experience ofnirvikalpa samadhi, that is referred to in The Life 104. Possiblyalso this had happened as has been described by Mrs. Funkewhen she and Sister Christine were out for a walk with Swamijias desired by him. The place where he possibly entered intonirvikalpa samadhi has now been tentatively identified. It wasbeneath a big oak tree about half a mile from the cottage, andSwamiji may have sat on a big, flat, boulder there. The incidentis described by Mrs. Funke as follows, \u201cThis morning therewas no class. He asked C and me to take a walk, as he wishedto be alone with us. (The others had been with him all summer,and he felt we should have a talk.) We went up a hill about halfa mile away. All was woods and solitude. Finally, he selected alow branched tree, and we sat under the low spreading branches.Instead of the expected talk, he suddenly said, `Now we shallmeditate. We shall be like Buddha under the Bo tree\u2019. Heseemed to turn to bronze, so still was he. Then a thundershowercame up, and it poured. He never noticed it. I raised myumbrella and protected him as much as possible. Completelyabsorbed in his meditation, he was oblivious of everything.INSPIRED TALKSSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1030Soon we heard shouts in the distance. The others had come outafter us with raincoats and umbrellas. Swamiji looked aroundregretfully, for we had to go, and said, `Once more I am inCalcutta in the rains.\u2019\u201d 105 So far as the Teacher himself wasconcerned, that was the crowning moment of his days atThousand Island Park. The pupils felt blessed at the sight.NOTES AND REFERENCES1 Letter to Alasinga, 1894, C.W., cited, V, 55.2 C.W., cited, VIII, 335.3 C.W., cited, IV, 65.4 C.W., cited, V, 70.5 C.W., cited, VI, 301.6 New Discoveries, cited, 558.7 Letter to Alasinga, 4 April 1895, Vani O Rachana, cited, VIII, 96.8 Ibid, 69.9 Ibid, 69.10 C.W., cited, V, 66_69.11 C.W., cited, VII, 343.12 After having lived with Swamiji for some time during which heassisted him in holding the classes, Landsberg took advantage of Swamiji\u2019sabsence for a few days from New York and decamped \u2014 for reasons which arenot clear.

            "title": "CHAPTER - 11VISITS TO ENGLAND AND CONSOLIDATION OFTHE WORK IN THE WESTI",
            "data": "1035A visit to England, the centre and stronghold of the power ofthe materialist West, was in Swami Vivekananda\u2019s thoughtsever since he had left India\u2019s shores in May, 1893. As we haveseen in the previous chapter, he was thinking of this visit bothwhen, soon after his arrival in America, he was despairing ofbeing able to find a foothold in that country and when, about ayear later, he found himself established there and his work wasprogressing apace. On 31 August 1894, he wrote to Alasinga,\u201cEverything done here prepares England ,\u201d and it seemed thatby this time he had resolved to proceed to that country as soonas he could be assured that the work in hand in America wouldnot suffer on account of his absence. The stars in their courseswere working to facilitate this and, soon afterwards, as we learnfrom his letter to Isabelle McKindley, 26 (?) October 1894 (seeChapter 9, Section VI above), he received an invitation fromMiss Henrietta Muller to come to England and be her guest.We shall soon describe the fortuitous circumstances whichbrought about this favourable turn in the development of hismission in the West but he, forever relying on divine direction,was quick to perceive that the hour had arrived when he shouldundertake the long contemplated journey to England. AtThousand Island Park, as we have seen, he had initiated two ofhis disciples, Leon Landsberg and Marie Louise, in sannyasa,SWAMI VIVEKANANDA1036and he now felt that they, together with Miss Waldo, could besafely expected to look after his work in America while he wasaway on a short visit to England.It seems that, as we have said above, even as early aswhen he was staying at Percy with Mr. Leggett, the latter hadinvited him to accompany him to Paris, where his marriagewith Mrs. Sturges was to be celebrated in about two months\u2019time. At about the same time he received renewed invitationsfrom Miss Henrietta Muller as well as an invitation fromMr. Sturdy to come to England, the latter assuring him thatthere was a great field for his work there and promising hishelp in the matter. The call from On High, which Swamijialways waited for before he embarked on any important venture,was now clearly heard. In a letter to Mr. Leggett from ThousandIsland Park dated 7 July 1895, Swamiji wrote, \u201cI do not wantto lose this opportunity of working in London. And so yourinvitation, coupled with the London one, is, I know a divinecall for further work.\u201d 1 Swamiji also said in this letter that hewanted to be at Thousand Island Park all that month, and thathe proposed to go to Chicago for a few days sometime inAugust, which he probably did before he left for London viaParis on 17 August. 2Inscrutable, as they say, are the ways in which divineplans are made but, as far as the human eye can see, the firststeps on the road leading to London had been taken by him,quite unawares, as far back as more than three years ago when,in the course of his wanderings as a monk he had arrived atKhandwa. There he had met a young loafer named AkshayKumar Ghosh, belonging to a respectable family of Calcuttaknown to him, who represented himself as an undergraduateof Calcutta University and was in search of employment.Recalling his own days of fruitless job-hunting in Calcutta in1037the dark days following upon his father\u2019s death, he was full ofsympathy for him. Presumably, Ghosh met him again somemonths later when he was in Bombay with the same tale ofwoe, for we now find Swamiji writing about him to his friend,Haribhai Viharidas Desai. In his letter Swamiji spoke aboutGhosh as \u201ca particular friend\u201d of his and requested him \u201cto dosomething for him.\u201d 3 On 22 August 1892, we find Swamijireminding Mr. Desai about Ghosh. 4 We lose trace of Ghoshfor a pretty long time after this, as did Swamiji, but evidentlyhe was not allowing the grass a while to grow under his feet.The next time we hear about him, and that is from Swamiji\u2019sletter to Isabelle McKindley dated 26 (?) October 1894, welearn that he was in London and staying with Miss Muller. Itseems to us that he got this lady (who had once met Swamiji inAmerica) seriously interested in Swamiji \u2014 so much so thatshe invited him to visit England and stay with her as her guestthere. If this surmise is correct, Ghosh, inconsequential as heis in our story, was God\u2019s instrument in initiating moves thatbrought Swamiji to England. As we know, however, Swamijicould not come, as he intended to do, in January or February,1895, and when he actually came, Ghosh had slipped out, andit was another person, \u2014 Mr. Sturdy, as we shall presently see,\u2014 who was instrumental in bringing him to that country. Itseems that in the meanwhile Ghosh had returned to India, andfor some time was staying at Madras. Later he was once againin England. In a letter to Alasinga, dated 6 May 1895, Swamijienquired, \u201cWhat about Babu Akshay Kumar Ghosh? I do nothear anything more from him.\u201d 5 We have no desire to giveGhosh undue importance in our narrative, or take any morenotice of him than is necessary for our purpose, but havingstated what we have done above, we may further mention thatin Pandit Beni Shankar Sarma\u2019s book (cited) we find a letterdated 5 January 1899 addressed by him to the ruler of KhetriCALL FOR A VISIT TO ENGLANDSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1038begging for \u00a3 100, which he said he needed as fees for the finalexamination qualifying him for the Bar. With that we have statedall or nearly all that we know about Ghosh.Mr. Edward T. Sturdy who, as we have said, cordiallyinvited Swamiji to visit England (possibly towards the end ofJune, 1895) was a young Englishman whom the lure of theoccult had brought to India some two years ago. He came acrossSwami Sivananda at Almora and became greatly attracted tohim. In a letter to Babu Pramadadas Mitra, who had beenestranged from Swamiji but remained in contact with some ofhis gurubhais, 9 May 1893, Swami Sivananda spoke about himas follows: \u201cAn English gentleman, a member of the LondonTheosophical Society, has come here. I am charmed by hismanner, behaviour and steadfastness in the way of Yoga. Theyare all like those of a Hindu Sannyasin, and he is a goodcompanion. He lives quite close to the asrama where I amstaying. Therefore, very often we have a discussion on religioustopics.\u201d In another letter, dated 18 May 1893, which wasprobably a reply to Mr. Mitra\u2019s reply to the above, SwamiSivananda again spoke about him as follows, \u201cThe name ofthe Theosophical Englishman is E.T. Sturdy. You do not knowhim perhaps. He is of a very quiet nature and his modes andmanners are just like those of a Brahmin. He takes food cookedby a Brahmin only. His meals, which he takes only once a dayat about 1 p.m., consist of about 6 chhataks of khichri (a mixedpreparation of rice and pulses.) He sleeps sparingly, not morethan four hours a day. His satvic quality has increasedconsiderably thereby. He is a great lover of knowledge. He isaged about thirty, and is unmarried.\u201d 6 Under the influence ofSwami Sivananda, he seems to have shed off his Theosophy tosome extent and veered to Vedanta. After returning to England,he wrote a letter to Swami Vivekananda, sometime in March,10391895, when Swamiji was busy with tours and lectures. Swamijiseems to have taken little notice of what Mr. Sturdy wrote tohim, as may be inferred from the fact that, in a letter to SwamiBrahmananda written in 1895 (precise date not stated), he wroteabout him as follows, \u201cBrother Tarak came across aTheosophist. He wrote a letter to me from London. I have nonews of him since then. . . . I have forgotten his name.\u201d 7Mr. Sturdy was a wealthy man, had a good knowledgeof Sanskrit and was interested in ancient Indian religious andphilosophical works, one of which, viz., the Narada Sutras, helater translated into English with the help of Swamiji. Possiblyhis first letter to Swamiji, referred to above, did not contain aninvitation to him to come to England; the second one, to whichSwamiji replied on 24 April 1895, also did not go beyond anenquiry about his intentions in the matter. Swamiji said, \u201cI amvery uncertain about coming to England. I know no one there,and here I am doing some work. The Lord will guide, in Hisown time.\u201d 8 The correspondence, however, shows that theywere stating their respective positions and attempting to findout how far their common ground extended. Mr. Sturdy seemsto have affirmed his faith in Advaita philosophy and disapprovalof superstitions. Swamiji said, \u201cI quite agree with you that onlythe Advaita philosophy can save mankind, whether in the Eastor the West, from `devil worship\u2019 and kindred superstitions,giving tone and strength to the very nature of man.\u201d He statedhis own views about Theosophy, without naming it, as follows,\u201cI am perfectly aware that although some truth underlies themass of mystical thought which has burst upon the Westernworld of late, it is for the most part full of motives unworthy orinsane. For this reason, I have never had anything to do withthese phases of religion, either in India or elsewhere, andmystics as a class are not very favourable to me.\u201dCALL FOR A VISIT TO ENGLANDSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1040Mr. Sturdy, it seems, was not yet quite ready to discardhis old love, Theosophy, and, in any case, he took some threemonths to write to Swamiji again. But this time he went a stepfurther and extended an invitation to Swamiji to visit England.Swamiji, in his reply (of which the date is not precisely known,but which was probably end of June, 1895), described it as a\u201cDivine Call,\u201d on the ground that he \u201chad a previousarrangement to come to Europe by the end of this August.\u201d(This was an obvious reference to Mr. Leggett\u2019s invitation tohim to accompany him to Paris.) As we have already seen, thefact that a call to visit England was coming from many quarters(he had also received a fresh invitation from Miss Muller)convinced Swamiji that there was a divine sanction for it. Inhis reply this time he told Mr. Sturdy that he was \u201cever readyto work with\u201d him, but he again seems to have warned himabout Theosophy. \u201c`Truth alone triumphs, not untruth. Throughtruth alone lies the way to Devayana (the way to the gods).\u2019Those who think that a little sugarcoating of untruth helps thespread of truth are mistaken, and will find in the long run thata single drop of poison poisons the whole mass. . . . The manwho is pure, and who dares, does all things. May the Lord everprotect you from illusion and delusion!\u201d 9 Without waiting fora reply, Swamiji wrote yet another letter to Mr. Sturdy, 9 August1895 \u2014 a rather long document explaining fully his views. 10He had found in his experience that minds which had onceleaned to mystical thought reverted again and again to it. Thatwas why perhaps he was so anxious that he and Mr. Sturdyshould know each other fully.The other invitation that Swamiji received was fromMiss Henrietta Muller who, as we have seen, had requestedhim to come to London and stay with her as guest once earlier.Her German father who had earned a huge fortune by building1041wooden ships in Chile (South America) and then settled downin England after selling off his business there had bequeathedto her a handsome income which she spent liberally in goodcauses. 11 Like Mr. Sturdy, she was a Theosophist and hadvisited India. Indians have good reasons to remember her namewith  gratitude because nearly the whole of the moneywherewith was purchased the land at Belur on which stand thetemples and headquarters of the Ramakrishna Mission wasprovided by her. \u201cThe plot (at Belur) was ultimately securedfor Rs.39,000, donated by Miss Henrietta Muller, on March 4,1898.\u201d 12 It was she also who, together with Mr. Sturdy andCaptain and Mrs. Sevier, bore the bulk of all the expenses ofhis English work. She had been already attracted to India\u2019sreligion and culture when she came to know of Swamiji,presumably, as we have said, from Akshay Kumar Ghosh.Intensely spiritual in her religious outlook she found inSwamiji\u2019s personality and teaching the essential facts ofspiritual life.Mahendranath Datta, who lived with her for some timein London and knew her intimately, has given us a glimpse ofher life and personality, which is amusing though, beingfragmentary, far from shows the real woman, Miss Muller.Miss Muller was an old woman, somewhat erratic intemperament, and peevish \u2014 sometimes unbearably so.Mahendranath and Swami Saradananda (who lived with herfor some time in 1896) did not know when and at what shewould take offence and generally avoided her. Even Swamijibehaved rather tactfully with her. The following story given byMahendranath is interesting. One day, while seated in the diningroom, Miss Muller said that during her travels in India she hadseen many lean cows, lean dogs, etc., everywhere, and observedthat the English who, she said and went on repeating manyCALL FOR A VISIT TO ENGLANDSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1042times saying, were a very kind people, would not allow such astate of things. She said that when horses and cattle becameold and life was unbearable for them \u2014 they became alsouseless \u2014 Englishmen killed them off. Swami Saradananda,who was listening quietly, said, \u201cWhen parents become old,life becomes unbearable for them. Why don\u2019t you kill themoff?\u201d (Miss Muller\u2019s old mother was  still living at the time.)Miss Muller became furious and left the room. For days shedid not talk with, or even look at, Swami Saradananda. 13 Apartfrom that, Miss Muller was an accomplished scholar, and hada deep regard for her teachers at Cambridge, one of whom wasDr. Vane, the author of \u201cThe Logic of Chance\u201d, to whom sheonce introduced Swamiji. She had a real love for Swamiji,kept herself in constant touch, in one way or another, with hisfriends and was always interested in the progress of his work.She often said that she was born as it were to assist him, andshe did what lay in her power to put his work on a firm footing.Once, in the latter part of 1896, she found so much interest inthis work that she even decided to give up the world. Withdifficulty Swamiji persuaded her not to do so, but to help theworld as much as she could by remaining in it.Leaving New York on 17 August 1895 Swamiji reachedParis on 24 August. He wrote to Mr. Sturdy on 26 August thatafter the wedding, which would happen within a week, wasover, he would proceed to England. On 5 September 1895 hewrote to him again that because he was very ill, he could notwrite earlier, that he had received a cordial invitation fromMiss Muller and that, since her place was near to his, he wouldstay there for a day or two and then come over to him.Meanwhile, Alasinga had written to him a letter informing himabout the propaganda that was being carried on against him inIndia by the Rev. Hume and other missionaries on the score of1043his taking unorthodox food. In reply to this letter which reachedhim on 9 September at Paris after being redirected fromAmerica, he wrote angrily that he \u201cate everything,\u201d etc., fromwhich, we must point out, it would be wrong to infer that thiswas an admission of the charge against him that he ate foodforbidden to Hindus. 14 It was written on the spur of the moment,as soon as Alasinga\u2019s letter was received, only a day before hestarted  for England. (For a fuller quotation from Swamiji\u2019sletter, see page 968-969 above.)On this his first visit to England, Swamiji did not comewith the intention of doing intensive work, or with a plan, or aprogramme. His American friends expected that this would bejust a holiday for him whereby he would have a chance ofrecuperating his badly shattered health. He had a warmreception and at Mr. Sturdy\u2019s home had physical rest and peaceof mind. \u201cIt is beautiful,\u201d he wrote to Miss MacLeod,September, 1895. \u201cHis wife is surely an angel, and his life isfull of India.\u201d 15 Before he came, he had wondered how theBritish people would receive him \u2014 one belonging to a subjectrace, come to preach his religion to them. This wonder wasgiving place to a greater wonder, namely, the great courtesywith which he was received by Englishmen of all classes whomhe met. In the same letter he went on to say, \u201cI found alreadyseveral retired Generals from India, they were very civil andpolite to me. That wonderful knowledge of the Americans thatidentify every black man with the Negro is entirely absent here,and nobody even stares at me in the street\u201d. He summed up hisimpressions about the English in the following words, \u201cI amvery much more at home here than anywhere out of India. TheEnglish people know us, we know them. The standard ofeducation and civilization is very high here \u2014 that makes agreat change, so does the education of many generations.\u201dSWAMIJI IN ENGLAND - FIRST IMPRESSIONSSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1044In a letter to Mrs. Ole Bull written on 24 September 1895,Swamiji said, \u201cI have not done any visible work as yet excepthelping Mr. Sturdy in studying Sanskrit.\u201d He wrote in the samestrain to Mrs. Leggett a few days later, in October, 1895 (precisedate not known), as follows: \u201cI am enjoying England very much.I am living with my friend on philosophy , leaving a little marginfor eating and smoking. We are getting nothing else but Dualismand Monism and all the rest of them.\u201d 16 This letter also containspraises of Englishmen. He noticed what many Indians whocame to England were surprised to find and have acknowledged\u2014 Ramesh Chandra Datta, the young Rabindra Nath Tagoreand many others \u2014 that the English in England were differentfrom the Anglo-Indians, both individually and as a people.Swamiji wrote, \u201cThe Englishmen here are very friendly. Excepta few Anglo-Indians, they do not hate black men at all. Noreven do they hoot at me in the streets. Sometimes I wonderwhether my face has turned white, but the mirror tells the truth.Yet they are wonderfully friendly here.\u201d He remarked thatEnglishmen who loved India were more Hindu than the Hindusthemselves. He was getting plenty of vegetables cooked in theIndian style (both Mr. Sturdy and Miss Muller with whom hestayed were vegetarians and also teetotalers). He met aProf. Fraser who was a high official in England and had spenthalf his life in India. He lived so much in ancient Indian thoughtand wisdom that he did not care a fig for anything out of India.17 He met Englishmen who thought that the Indian caste systemwas the only solution of the social problem. They hatedsocialists and other social democrats, said he.Of course, these were his first impressions of the Englishpeople, which were derived from his contacts within the circleof a few friends, who represented but a small cross-section ofthe British people. He retained his respect for the great qualities1045of the English people, in particular their courage and tenacity,which always made a special appeal to him. One would betotally mistaken, however if, from his observations of the time,one gathered the impression that at any time he fell in lovewith British imperialism which, with the downfall of the Liberalgovernment and accession of the Conservatives to power in1895 \u2014 about the time of his landing on English soil \u2014 wasentering into a new and ugly phase. About his views onimperialism we shall speak later; about his ideas on Britishrule in India the reader has already learned something from hisletter to Mary Hale, which we have quoted in a previousChapter. One reason why he had favourable views aboutEngland at the time was that he had seen enough of the darkside of American life, and England seemed to provide a pleasingcontrast. In a letter to Swami Akhandananda, dated 13November 1895, he said, \u201cYou might have noticed from thepapers that our movement is steadily gaining ground in England.Every enterprise in this country takes some time to have a go.The Americans are quick, but they are somewhat like the strawon fire, ready to be extinguished.\u201d 18 He noted anotherpeculiarity in England, which he wrote about in his letter toMrs. Bull, referred to above, \u201cAgain, here the men \u2014 and themost highly educated \u2014 take the greatest interest in Indianthought, and very few women. The woman\u2019s sphere is narrowerhere than in America.\u201d 19 As we have said above, he found thatthere was less colour prejudice in England than in America.We shall see that later he was disillusioned on this subject.In a letter to Mrs. Bull dated 6 October 1895 20 Swamijisaid that, along with Mr. Sturdy, he was translating a little bookon Bhakti, with copious commentaries, which was to bepublished soon. \u201cWe do not wish to make any noise but to goquietly,\u201d he said. He told her, however, that he was to deliverSWAMIJI IN ENGLAND - FIRST IMPRESSIONSSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1046two lectures in London and one in Maidenhead which, heexpected, would open the way to some classes and parlourlectures. Evidently, Mr. Sturdy, as we learn from Swamiji\u2019sletter to Swami Brahmananda dated 4 October 1895, waskeeping him quite busy with work he was personally interestedin. He had also requested Swamiji to send for a Sannyasin,well versed in Sanskrit and English, to help him in his work inSwamiji\u2019s absence. Mr. Sturdy offered to bear all expenses inthis connection. In a letter to Swami Brahmananda, the date ofwhich is not ascertainable beyond that it was written fromMr. Sturdy\u2019s house at Reading in 1895, Swamiji said that thenew Swami was \u201cto teach a little Sanskrit, or translate a bit inmy absence, that\u2019s all.\u201d 21 In Vani O Rachana 22 which givesthe letter in its original Bengali, we find the additional words,\u201calong with Sturdy.\u201d In another letter, which was perhapswritten a little earlier, and addressed to SwamiRamakrishnananda, 23 Swamiji had stated more fully the natureof the work the new Swami would have to do. \u201cHis task,\u201d saidSwamiji, \u201cwould be to give some instructions, teach Vedanta,etc., give some little help in translation work to the discipleswho would be left here by me and occasionally deliver lectures,etc.\u201d It is clear that the incoming Swami would principallyhave to assist Mr. Sturdy in his studies in Indian religious loreand help him in translating some of them into English. It doesnot appear that during the time he was in Mr. Sturdy\u2019s house,Swamiji did much to propagate Vedanta in England, or eventhat he envisaged that such work should be done when he wasaway by anyone of his gurubhais who might respond to hiscalls to come over to England. One of the causes of his inactivityduring his first three or four weeks\u2019 stay in England possiblyalso was that he was still in very poor health. As we have seen,he was very unwell when he was in Paris and, as he wrote toSwami Brahmananda from Reading (date simply given as10471895), his incessant lecturing tours were making his constitutionvery nervous, causing insomnia and other troubles.One of the two lectures that he said he had to give inLondon in October was surely the one delivered at Princes\u2019Hall, Piccadilly, one of the most fashionable places in London,on 22 October 1895. It was attended by people representing allwalks of life and some of the best thinkers of the day. It  was agreat and instantaneous success, and the next morning thejournals were filled with complimentary comments. Accordingto one account, the lecture was a most fearless exposition ofthe pantheistic philosophy of the Vedanta School ( The IndianMirror , Calcutta, 15 November 1895.) \u201cThere is only one soulin the universe,\u201d Swamiji is reported inter alia to have said inthe course of his lectures, \u201cthere is no `you\u2019 or `me\u2019; all varietyis merged with the absolute unity, the one infinite existence \u2014God.\u201d ( Ibid .) In a peroration of twenty minutes, as we learnfrom the comments in The Standard and The London DailyChronicle , Swamiji made a scathing criticism of Westernmaterial prosperity which had produced bloody wars, andobserved that at such a price the mild Hindu would have noneof their vaunted civilization. He also said that Western scienceand inventions had done little for man as compared with whathalf a dozen words spoken by Buddha or Jesus had done.After the lecture was delivered a correspondent of TheWestminster Gazette met the Swami, and his report of theinterview was published in the paper on the following day. It isreproduced under its caption \u201cAn Indian Yogi in London\u201d inC. W. 24 In reply to a question, Swamiji told this interviewerwhat he had repeated many times in his replies to similarquestions in America, that he had never the intention of forminga sect or a society, and that it was not in his programme to doSWAMIJI IN ENGLAND - FIRST IMPRESSIONSSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1048so in England. He said, \u201cI propound a philosophy which canserve as a basis to every possible religious system in the world,and my attitude towards all of them is one of extreme sympathy\u2014 my teaching is antagonistic to none. I direct my attention tothe individual, to make him strong, to teach him that he himselfis divine, and I call upon men to make themselves consciousof this divinity within. That is really the ideal \u2014 conscious orunconscious \u2014 of every religion.\u201d The interviewer was highlyimpressed with  the Swami\u2019s personality \u2014 his face lights up,he noted, like that of a child, it is so simple, straightforwardand honest. The report ended with the words, \u201cI then took myleave from one of the most original of men that I have had thehonour of meeting.\u201dWe have no record of the second public lecture in Londonthat Swamiji spoke of in the abovementioned letter to Mrs. Bull,if it was at all delivered. We, however, know from a news itemin The Indian Mirror , Calcutta, of 1 December 1895 25 that hedelivered a lecture at the weekly meeting of the Balloon Society(presumably in the last week of October) on \u201cMan and Societyin the Light of Vedanta\u201d, and it is probable that this was thesecond lecture. But the Piccadilly lecture made him known allover London and the work that he was doing so far, which wasof a private nature, now assumed a public aspect. 26 Visitorspoured in, and he received numerous invitations to speak inprivate drawing rooms and hold classes. Among the earliestvisitors to him was Lady Isabel Margesson, at whose invitationone evening he held a class in her drawing room, whereMiss Margaret Noble first saw him. We shall presently speakmore fully about this momentous meeting which revolutionizedMiss Noble\u2019s life. Continuing with our narrative of Swamiji\u2019slife in London after 22 October, we find him holdingphilosophical discussions with Mr Sturdy and visiting the1049library of the Royal Asiatic Society of London in his companyfor consulting works like the \u201cHemadrikosha\u201d, holding talkswith visitors like Mr. Silverlock and his friend \u2014 the first \u2014named a young engineer and the latter a grain dealer \u2014 onreligion, 27 holding private classes both in his rented lodgingsat 80, Oakley Street, Chelsea (from 2 November) and at theresidences of a few other people, among whom we find oneMr. Chamier mentioned, and delivering a lecture at the BalboaSociety (5 November), another before Mr. Moncure Conway\u2019sEthical Society (10 November), etcOn Swamiji\u2019s work in England, Mr. Sturdy wrote a letter,dated London 24 October 1895, to the Editor of The IndianMirror , Calcutta, which was published in that paper in its issueof 21 November 1895. We give here a few extracts from thisletter, since it gives an idea of the situation as viewed both bySwamiji and by Mr. Sturdy. \u201cSwami Vivekananda has now beenin England some weeks and already some work has been done,and commencement of interest shown him in the Press. TheStandard , one of the most conservative and influential papersin the country, gave a very fair and lucid account of the Swami\u2019sfirst address to a British audience at Princes\u2019 Hall, London.Classes have now been set on foot, and the audience at themshows signs of rapidly increasing. The Swami unfortunatelycannot spare more time here from his labours in America, andhis friends will have to carry on the work which is nowcommencing. He will, however, return next summer, and inthe late autumn may probably return to India to stimulate workwhich he has already partially initiated there, and to unite itssympathies with those of the Western world, and vice versa .\u201cThe Swami, however, has no intention of founding asociety, nor does he believe in societies in relation to religiousTHE PICCADILLY LECTURESWAMI VIVEKANANDA1050or philosophical propagations. The great religions of the worldhave all been spread without any organized societies, and it isonly in times of decay that organization enters into religion.Whatever be the power of organizations in spreading social orpolitical ideas, in religion, the Swami maintains, as his master,the late Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa Deva before him,societies only create sects and organizations corruption. Thegreat strength of the Vedanta system lies in its being perfectlyfree of organizations and leaving individuals perfect freedomof development. That is the real secret of its strength and allembraciveness.\u201cThe great masters left only a few disciples, but eachwas perfect and strong in himself. Numbers do not count, it isthe quality, not the quantity that is necessary for the uprising ofthe ancient system of the East, and all modern efforts on theWestern plans of close organizations, elaborate code makinghave ended in fanaticism, corruption, and even outrageousfraud.\u201cIn religion, therefore, the ancient tradition of the East,leaving the individual perfect freedom of choice and method,being also the outcome of ages of experience of Sages whohave given all the religions to the world, has proved itself theleast dangerous and most fruitful of good results. . . .\u201d 28So Swamiji had in the short space of his three months\u2019stay in England done substantial work and left it to be continuedby a few devoted followers like Mr. Sturdy. What may bedescribed as the greatest thing that happened at this time,however, was not what was being laboriously done by him forspreading the message of Vedanta in England but whatpropitious Fate, working in its own silent and inscrutable way,1051and was planning to give him. This was the great gift of adaughter in the spirit for himself, and for India one who, in hisown words, was destined to be to her \u201cfuture son, the mistress,servant, friend in one.\u201d The future Nivedita was born on 28October 1867 at a small Irish town in a family, which was ofScotch extraction but all members of which had identifiedthemselves with the fortunes of the downtrodden native Irishand for at least two generations had dedicated themselves tothe service of the Church of God. Miss Margaret ElizabethNoble, as she was called then, had received a careful educationand, at the time of her first meeting with Swamiji, was thePrincipal of a school of her own and one of the conspicuousmembers and Secretary of the Sesame Club, founded inconnection with educational purposes. As we have said above,Miss Noble first saw Swamiji at Lady  Margesson\u2019s drawingroom and, as she later said, was \u201cdeeply attracted by hispersonality\u201d. She also attended Swamiji\u2019s talks on 16 and 25November, and \u201cthe time came, before the Swami left England,when,\u201d said she, \u201cI addressed him as Master.\u201d She, however,took a pretty long time to accept Swamiji\u2019s philosophical ideasand, at his meetings, was often found interrupting in the midstof his talks with \u201cBut, Swami.\u201d Referring to this scepticism ofhers, for which she was later teased by \u201ca more fortunatedisciple\u201d who claimed that she had been able to accept everystatement she had ever heard him make, Swamiji once said asfollows, \u201cLet none regret that they were difficult to convince!I fought my Master for six long years, with the result that Iknow every inch of the way! Every inch of the way!\u201d 29Sister Nivedita\u2019s own narration of her first meeting withSwami Vivekananda is a literary masterpiece, which we quotehere in full. \u201cThe time was a cold Sunday afternoon inNovember, and the place, it is true, a West end drawing room.MISS NOBLE AND SWAMI VIVEKANANDASWAMI VIVEKANANDA1052But he was seated, facing a half circle of listeners, with the fireon the hearth behind him, and as he answered question afterquestion, breaking now and then into the chanting of someSanskrit text in illustration of his reply, the scene must haveappeared to him, while twilight passed into darkness, only as acurious variant upon the Indian garden, or on the group ofhearers gathered at sundown round the Sadhu who sits besidethe well, or under the tree outside the village bounds. Neveragain in England did I see the Swami, as a teacher, in suchsimple fashion. Later, he was always lecturing, or the questionshe answered were put with formality by members of largeraudiences. Only this first time we were but fifteen or sixteenguests, intimate friends, many of us, and he sat amongst us, inhis crimson robe and girdle, as one bringing us news from a farland, with a curious habit of saying now and again `Shiva!Shiva!\u2019 and wearing that look of mingled gentleness andloftiness, that one sees on the faces of those who live much inmeditation, that look, perhaps, that Raphael has painted for us,on the brow of the Sistine Child.\u201cThat afternoon is now ten years ago, and fragments onlyof the talk come back to me. But never to be forgotten are theSanskrit verses that he chanted for us, in those wonderfulEastern tones, at once so reminiscent of, and yet so differentfrom, the Gregorian music of our own churches.\u201d 30Sister Nivedita confessed that at the end of this lectureneither she nor any of the other guests thought that there wasanything new in the lecture. As she went about the tasks of thatweek, however, it dawned on her slowly that it was unjust todismiss in such a fashion the message of a new mind and astrange culture. It occurred to her that though each separatedictum might find its echo or its fellow amongst things alreadyheard or already thought, yet it had never yet fallen to her lot1053to meet with a thinker who in one short hour had been able toexpress all that she had hitherto regarded as highest and best.She, therefore, as we have said above, attended the two moreremaining lectures of Swamiji, and took notes of them. Thefeeling that great music wakes in us, says she, grows anddeepens with its repetition. Similarly, the more she read overthe notes she had taken, they seemed to be more wonderfulthan they had done at first. And so slowly the process went onthat changed Miss Noble into Sister Nivedita. It was a fairlylong story and will unfold itself in our later narrations of herlife. Each day she was making new discoveries in Swamiji\u2019steachings, but before he had left London, she had made onethat impressed her very much. It was that the Swami alwaystook his stand on  what was noblest and best in those whocame in contact with him. An illustration used by himastonished her.On the occasion Swamiji was again lecturing one eveningin a West end drawing room where he had a highly culturedaudience, composed mostly of fashionable young mothers. Hewas speaking on the greatness of the path of Love, showing towhat heights of selflessness it leads and how it draws out thevery best faculties of the soul. In elucidating his remarks hesaid, \u201cSuppose a tiger should suddenly appear before you inthe streets. How terror-stricken you would be, and how eageryou would all be to fly away for your very lives. But \u2014 and histone became changed and suddenly lighted up with that strengthand fearlessness which the spiritual fire alone endows in itsfullest measure, \u2014 suppose, there was a baby in the path of thetiger. Where would your place be then? At the mouth of thetiger \u2014 any of you \u2014 I am sure of it.\u201d His hearers were carriedaway by this splendid remark, at once a compliment to thepossibilities within them and the power of arousing their veryMISS NOBLE AND SWAMI VIVEKANANDASWAMI VIVEKANANDA1054highest spiritual natures. Not long after this talk Swamiji leftfor New York, but the impression such teachings producedremained with the hearers for life, and we do not wonder thatwere long many of them called him Master.IIAfter a distressing voyage lasting ten days in an awfully roughsea, during which for the first time in his life he suffered fromseasickness, Swamiji reached New York on Friday, 6 December1895. Swami Kripananda, who had come to receive him at theharbour, immediately escorted him to 228 West 39th Street,where he had already rented two large parlour rooms in thesecond storey of the building that could accommodate 150persons at lecture time. The house was the same in whichSwami  Kripananda had occupied a small room from 19 Aprilto 10 July and again in November. One of the rooms faced theroad and the other was behind it. In the beginning Swamiji andSwami Kripananda occupied a room each \u2014 Swamiji havingthe room in the back. But as the work increased SwamiKripananda shifted to a room in the topmost storey of thebuilding, and Swamiji used the front room for his classes andthe room behind as his bedroom. We have a glimpse of theircommon household from a letter from Swami Kripananda toMrs. Ole Bull dated 10 December 1895. \u201cWe had commonhouse holding, and I gave my share to sharing the expense ofthe victuals,\u201d wrote he. These victuals were cooked in thecommunity kitchen, Swamiji sometimes doing the cooking andSwami Kripananda (as we have seen) having had to tear hishairs over washing an additional number of pots and pans.The arrangement, however, did not go on for long for, aswe learn from Sister Devamata, one day Swamiji told1055Miss Waldo, \u201cThe food here seems so unclean. Would it bepossible for you to cook for me?\u201d She at once ran to the landladyand obtained permission to use the kitchen. Then from her ownstore she gathered together cooking utensils and groceries.These she carried with her the following morning. This meanta lot of trouble for her as she lived at the far end of Brooklyn,though she cheerfully went through it. To quote from SisterDevamata\u2019s memoirs, 31 \u201cThe only means of transportation wasa jogging horse cart, and it required two hours to reach theSwami\u2019s lodging at 38 street New York. Undaunted, everymorning she found her way to it at 8 o\u2019clock or earlier, and at9 or 10 o\u2019clock at night she was on her way home again. Whenthere was a free day, the journey was reversed. It was the Swamiwho took the jogging horse cart, travelled the two hours andcooked the meals. He found genuine rest and relaxation in thefreedom and quiet  of Miss Waldo\u2019s simple home. The kitchenwas on the top floor of the house, in front of it the dining roomfull of sunshine and potted plants. As the Swami invented newdishes, he ran back and forth from one room to the other like achild at play.\u201dSister Devamata bears testimony to Miss Waldo\u2019sdevotion to Swamiji, which is worth recording here. We quotethe following from her memoirs, though it is rather lengthy,\u201cIn all this close association with Swamiji, Waldo said to melater, `it seems strange that the idea of renunciation neveroccurred to me. Nor did I ever think seriously of followinghim to India. I seemed to belong to America. Yet there wasnothing that I would not have done for him. When he first cameto New York, he insisted on wearing his orange robeeverywhere. It required no little courage to walk up Broadwaybeside that flaming coat. As the Swami strode along in lordlyindifference, with me just behind, half out of breath trying toSWAMIJI RETURNS TO AMERICASWAMI VIVEKANANDA1056keep up with him, every eye was turned upon us, and on everylip the question, `What are they?\u2019 Later she persuaded him toadopt more subdued clothing for the street.\u201cMiss Waldo had had long experience in teachers. Shehad sat at the feet of many. The fear was in her heart that thisnew Hindu Swami might prove wanting. She was alwayssearching for a sign of weakness. It came. She and the Swamiwere together in a New York drawing room. It was on the firstfloor, with high folding doors at one end, two large windows atthe other, and between them a mirror reaching from floor toceiling. This mirror seemed to fascinate the Swami. He stoodbefore it again and again, gazing at himself intensely, lost inthought. Miss Waldo\u2019s eyes followed him anxiously. `Now thebubble is going to burst,\u2019 she thought. `He is full of personalvanity.\u2019 Suddenly he turned to her and said, `Ellen, it is thestrangest thing. I cannot remember how I look. I look and lookat myself in the glass, but the  moment I turn away I forgetcompletely what I look like.\u2019 On another day Swamiji foundMiss Waldo in tears. He asked her anxiously about it. Shereplied, `I seem unable to please you. Even when others annoyyou, you scold me for it.\u2019 Swamiji replied, `I do not know thosepeople enough to scold them. Whom can I scold if I cannotscold my own?\u2019 Miss Waldo did not thenceforward feel theSwami\u2019s scolding. On the contrary, it was a sign of nearness.\u201dAccording to some biographers, Swamiji had entrustedMiss Waldo with conducting Raja Yoga classes during hisabsence in England. This view has been disputed on the groundof lack of evidence to support it, though it is admitted thatSwamiji did have a high opinion about Miss Waldo\u2019s grasp ofhis teachings. 32 Some statements in The Life which areevidently based on a report on the subject given by Leon1057Landsberg in his newsletter of 7 December 1895 to the effectthat during Swamiji\u2019s absence in England Vedanta work madea considerable progress in America have also been challenged.33 It has been asserted that Swamiji himself did not expect thework in America to go on well during his absence and hisanxiety to return quickly to America in spite of the fact that hisfriends in England desired that he should stay there a littlelonger is considered as an indication of this. Other evidences,however, show that Swamiji expected Miss Waldo and his otherAmerican disciples to carry on the work in America when heleft either for England or for India. In a letter to Miss Waldofrom England dated 8 October 1896, Swamiji wrote, \u201cI will bethousand times more pleased to see one of you start than anynumber of Hindus securing success in America \u2014 even one ofmy brethren. `Man wants victory from everywhere but defeatfrom his own children.\u2019 . . . Make a blaze! Make a blaze!\u201d 34With respect to the notes that Miss Waldo had taken of histalks at Thousand Island Park, Swamiji had  said, \u201cHow couldyou have caught my thoughts and words so perfectly? It is as ifI heard myself speaking\u201d. Apart from the fact that there isnothing inherently improbable about Swamiji desiring to leavethe American work to his American disciples, there are somepositive facts that support the statement in The Life 35 thatMiss Waldo and Landsberg did carry on such work. Accordingto this authority, the two not only held regular weekly meetingson the Vedanta philosophy in New York, but carried the Swami\u2019smessage to other American cities. The Life further tells us thateverywhere they found a ready hearing and succeeded informing new centres, such as at Buffalo (N. Y.) and Detroit.From a letter written by Swami Abhayananda to Mrs. Ole Bulldated 21 November 1895 we know that she was preachingVedanta in the village of Greenwich (New York), though theaudience never exceeded eight to nine persons (a fact whichSWAMIJI RETURNS TO AMERICASWAMI VIVEKANANDA1058she ascribed to the inactivity of the Vedanta Society). We learnfrom another letter from Swami Kripananda dated 3 January1896 (see Section III below) that they assisted Swamiji inVedanta work even after he returned to America.We have referred to the indifference of the New Yorkpress to Swamiji\u2019s Vedanta classes in the winter of 1895. Hewas more fortunate in respect of the work that he was to beginnow for, almost immediately on his arrival at New York, areporter of The New York Herald sought an interview with him,the result of which was published in his paper on 8 Decemberand reprinted in part in the Brahmavadin on 18 January 1896and in extenso in The Indian Mirror on 25 March 1896. Thearticle gave a fairly good account of Swamiji\u2019s personality, hisactivities, and a brief sketch of his doctrines. It began as follows,\u201cMany well-known persons are seeking to follow the teachingof Swami Vivekananda\u2019s Philosophy. Swami Vivekananda is aname to conjure with in certain circles of  New York Societytoday \u2014 and these not the least wealthy or intellectual....\u201d 36England apparently had made Swamiji better known to NewYork (the press circles, at any rate) as America had made himknown to England. However that was, only after three days ofrest, during which he received constant visits, or constantlyvisited his friends, he began, or rather resumed his Vedantaclasses. He wanted to do quiet work, giving up all connectionwith money, as he had done in England. He wrote to Mrs. Bullon 8 December 1895, \u201cEven in religion, there is no useoverstocking the market. The supply must follow the demand,and demand alone. If people want to hear me, they will get uplectures. I need not bother myself about these things.\u201d He alsosaid, \u201cThe public lecture plan I intend to give up entirely, as Ifind the best thing for me is to step entirely out of the moneyquestion \u2014 either in public lectures or private classes. In the1059long run it does harm and sets a bad example.\u201d 37 According toThe Life , a rich Boston lady had promised him help, but shewas hindered from doing so. Voluntary contributions wereaccepted at his classes, but speaking about his audience there,Sister Devamata makes the following statement which givesus an idea of the nature of these contributions. \u201cIt was aheterogeneous gathering at these classes in these shabbylodgings \u2014 old and young, rich and poor, wise and foolish;stingy men who dropped a button in the collection basket andmore generous men, who gave a dollar bill, or even two.\u201d(Though, as we have said above, Sister Devamata\u2019s memory,at the time of her writing, had become confused as to the firstand second lecture sessions, this statement rather applies tothe second session, or does so more to it than to the first.)Swamiji\u2019s classes went on from 9 December right up toChristmas Eve (24 December 1895), even on which day hetook a class on Bhakti Yoga before he went to the house of theLeggetts at Ridgely Manor for a few days\u2019 rest and recreation.In the following year (1896), his classes began early in the firstweek. According to The Life , 38 at this time \u201che set himself tothe task of preaching Karma Yoga in particular, and gave allthose lessons that are embodied in the book known as `KarmaYoga\u2019, which is regarded by some as his masterpiece.\u201d In aletter to Mrs. Bull dated 10 December 1895, Swami Kripanandasaid that Swamiji had begun his classes in the previous eveningwith explaining the ways of the various yogas and that he \u201cwasall Bhakti.\u201d He told Mrs. Bull that he was enclosing the timetable for the lectures on the various yogas. The time table isnot found, but the statement shows that Swamiji not onlylectured on Karma Yoga but on Raja, Bhakti, and Jnana Yogasalso. Earlier, in a letter to Miss Waldo dated 19 November,Swami Kripananda had given an idea of the subjects thatSWAMIJI RETURNS TO AMERICASWAMI VIVEKANANDA1060Swamiji planned to deal with in his coming New York classes.He gave some of the subjects of the proposed discourses as \u2014Prana and its Modifications, Mind, its Functions and Control,the chief Yoga Methods, the Upanishads, etc. It is thus clearthat \u201cthe Swami wanted to teach much in a short time; hewanted this season to give all aspects of his message a detailedand complete form.\u201d The programme followed possibly wasTuesdays bhakti, Wednesdays raja, Thursdays karma, Fridaysjnana, Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays Upanishads, Sankhyaphilosophy, and Questions and Answers. It seems that at thistime he proposed to give the western world, as he had done tohis pupils earlier at Thousand Island Park, \u201chis message in allits fullness.\u201d 39The two parlour rooms could accommodate 150 persons,but it appears that the audience never exceeded 120. \u201cWe havenow 70 to 80 people,\u201d Swami Kripananda, wrote on 14 January.In February 1896 Swamiji wrote to Mr. Sturdy, \u201cThe averageattendance varies between 70 to 120.\u201d 40 Apart from the numberof the audience, it was an earnest body of men and women andincluded many persons distinguished in arts and science. In anarticle in the New York Herald published on 10 January 1896,the reporter spoke of a \u201cwell-dressed audience of distinguishedappearance.\u201d Among those who probably attended the lectureswere Swamiji\u2019s friends and disciples \u2014 Miss Waldo, Mr. AndMrs. Leggett, the Goodyear\u2019s, the Guernseys, Mr. Goodwin,Miss Mary Phillips, Miss Ruth Ellis, Dr. Wight, (but notMrs. Bull, who was unable to come to New York till the secondweek of February, or Miss Macleod who was in Europe), EmmaThursby and Antoinette Sterling who were world-famoussongstresses, Mary Mapas Dodge, Kate Douglas Wiggin andElla Wheeler Wilcox who were famous in the literary world,and from time to time the famous scientist Nicholas Tesla.1061Mr. Goodwin, it may be noted, attended the lectures notonly to listen to them but to take down in shorthand extensivenotes, to which, as we have said above, the world owes thepreservation of much of Swamiji\u2019s teachings. In this connection,however, one may note that there were some among the lecturesand writings of this time that have come down to us in full andauthoritative form without Mr. Goodwin\u2019s help. Among theseare parts, at least, of Bhakti Yoga which was first published ineight consecutive installments in the Brahmavadin . InDecember 1895 Swami Vivekananda started writing twoarticles and finished them before Christmas. They were typedout, not by Mr. Goodwin but by Swami Kripananda, and werethe first two installments of the series above mentioned. Thethird installment of the series which was based on two lecturesdelivered by Swamiji, and also typed out by Swami Kripananda,was published in that paper. For the purpose, Swami Kripanandahad rented a typewriter at $5 a month given to him by Mrs. Bull.Swami Kripananda  had also learned shorthand but he was byno means as proficient in it as Mr. Goodwin.As we have seen, Swami Vivekananda was asked bypeople in America several times during his lecture tours whetherhe wanted to form a sect, or a society in the country. Includedin the mischievous propaganda of the missionaries was aspecific allegation that he was out on a proselytizing mission.He always strongly repudiated the idea and asserted rather thathis purpose was to earn some money for a project he had inview for his country. But as his followers increased in numberand were wider spread and separated by distances over a goodpart of the country, the need of some organization was felt.Some of his teachings were evidently mis-understood, even bythose who eagerly attended his classes, and his devotedfollowing felt the need of keeping them pure as much asORGANISING THE AMERICAN WORKSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1062spreading them. We have already seen that his Raja Yogalectures were eagerly taken up by some of his followers (suchas Stella who attended the talks at Thousand Island Park) asthe way to physical beauty, not to speak of vulgar people whothought that they could bestow occult powers on those whopractised that branch of Yoga. Swamiji, nevertheless, had asoft corner in his heart for erring disciples. We read thefollowing in Sister Christine\u2019s memoirs, \u201cAsked whether heendorsed a certain woman who was going about the country asa religious teacher and using his name and reputation to get afollowing, he said, `Poor thing! She has a husband to support,and she must get a certain amount every month.\u2019 `But, Swami\u2019,someone said, `she claims to be authorized by you to preparestudents for your teaching. She says, if we go through her twopreliminary classes, then we will be ready to be taught by you.It is so absurd and unscrupulous. To the first class she givesgymnastic exercises, and to the second she dictates somequotations, or gems which she has gathered from various bookson occultism. Should she be allowed to mislead people, taketheir money, and use your name?\u2019 All that he said was, `Poorthing! Poor thing! Shiva! Shiva!\u201d 41As he had laughingly told Mrs. Lyon, SwamiVivekananda \u201cloved\u201d the American genius for organizing allwork they undertook \u2014 in which respect he thought Indians,including himself, were very deficient. He had no idea oforganizing his followers into a religious sect, or society and,as we have seen, Mr. Sturdy in his letter to The Indian Mirroremphasized this point. The latter did so, it would seem, becauseonce during his stay in London, after he had a talk with twoyoung visitors, one Mr. Silverlock and his friend (p. 1000above), who had expressed a wish to learn what were the ritualsof his religion, Swamiji had thought he should fix on some1063rituals as soon as possible. In a letter to Mr. Sturdy, he hadsaid, \u201cIt is absolutely necessary to form some ritual and aChurch. That is to say, we must fix on some ritual as fast as wecan.\u201d 42 Mr. Sturdy perhaps having objected to it, he gave upthe idea. On the very following day, 2 November 1895, he wroteagain to Mr. Sturdy, \u201cI think you are right; we shall work onour own lines and let things grow.\u201d 43 However, speciallybecause he was overburdened with work and his health wasfailing, on his return to America, he again thought of formingan organization. As we have seen, he had already formed aVedanta society in New York in November, 1894 \u2014 he was atthat time thinking of founding a number of other societies also\u2014 and his object, even then, may have been more thantransferring to others the task of looking after their financialadministration. (See p. 855-856, above.)We do not know much about that society, but we at leastknow that it continued to exist, because in the fall of 1895 wehave a reference to it in a letter from Swami Abhayananda toMrs. Bull, who (the former) complained that it did not assisther in her lecturing work in Greenwich. (This, by the way,rather supports the idea that Swamiji\u2019s object in founding ithad been wider than giving it charge of the financial part of hiswork.) However that was, it had not done much beyond keepingitself alive. In December, 1895, after he had returned toAmerica, Swamiji was thinking of ways and means wherebyto revitalize it. He succeeded in forming an executive committeewithin the old Vedanta Society, by means of which it \u201ccouldcome of age, so to speak and attend to business.\u201d We do notknow anything about its composition, but it probably consistedof some of his more active friends, such as Miss Mary Phillips,Dr. Lewis G. Janes, Mrs. Ole Bull, Emma Thursby, Dr. EdwardORGANISING THE AMERICAN WORKSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1064G. Day, Mr. and Mrs. Leggett, Mrs. Arthur Smith, Mr. andMrs. Walter Goodyear, Mrs. Day and her sister.In a letter to Mr. Sturdy dated 16 January 1896, SwamiVivekananda spoke about this organization as follows, \u201cI haveseparated myself entirely from money questions, yet without itthe movement cannot go on. So necessarily I have to makeover everything executive to a committee, which will look afterthese things in my absence. Steady work is not in the line ofthe Americans. The only way they work is in a herd. So letthem have it. As to the teaching part, my friends will go overthis country from place to place, each one independent, and letthem form independent circles. That is the easiest way to spread.Then, when there will be sufficient strength, we shall haveyearly gatherings to concentrate our energies.\u201d 44 In the sameletter Swamiji told Mr. Sturdy that he hoped to get a piece ofland in the country, and some buildings on it, plenty of treesand a river, to serve as a summer meditation resort. Swamijithought that a committee was needed not only to look after theproject but also \u201cfor the handling of money and printing andother matters.\u201d Evidently he was not only thinking of themanagement of his classes and public lectures but envisagingannual conferences of his followers, having perhaps in his mindthe pattern of the Greenacre Conferences. The plot of landmentioned in this letter seems, by the way, to be a plot of191 acres in the Catskill mountains about which he spoke in aletter to Mrs. Ole Bull dated 25 January 1896 (wrongly datedthere as 24 January 1895).The Committee immediately took up the question of theproper recording of Swamiji\u2019s lectures with a view to theirpublication sooner or later. They advertised for a stenographerto do the task and towards the end of December selected one1065of the applicants who, however, was found unequal to the task.Another man was appointed in his place (it is possible that oneof the two men thus tried was Swami Kripananda himself who,as we have seen above, had lately learned steno typing), but hetoo was unsuitable. Then came Mr. J. J. Goodwin, about whomwe have already spoken a number of times above and whoremained till his death Swamiji\u2019s stenographer, friend, personalassistant, disciple, and what not. The Committee appointedhim and then seems to have gone to sleep. It was not till SwamiAbhedananda arrived in New York from London (6 August1897) that Vedanta work started afresh with vigour. He notonly toured over a great part of America lecturing on Vedanta(see Chapter 13, Section III below) but, in October, 1898, gotthe old society converted into the New York Vedanta Societyand had it incorporated and registered under the laws of theState of New York. The president of the new society wasMr. Francis Leggett, but it was not till 1900 when Swamijiwas in California that its trustees opened a membership roll.Its work was satisfactory, and Swamiji wrote about it toMrs. Ole Bull on 1 April 1900 from San Francisco as follows,\u201cSo Mr. Leggett has got the V. Society up. Good.\u201d 45IIIAccording to The Life , 46 Swami Vivekananda took advantageof the Christmas holidays to pay a visit to Boston as the guestof Mrs. Ole Bull. Actually, as we have seen above, he went toRidgely Manor. On his return to New York he commenced aseries of stirring public lectures at Hardeman Hall on Sundays,beginning from 5 January 1896. At the same time, he wascontinuing with his Vedanta classes at his headquarters, whichnow became overcrowded as many of those who listened toSUCCESS OF THE  AMERICAN WORKSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1066his public lectures began to come to these classes also. Allthese lectures were free of charge. Besides these, he deliveredlectures also before the Metaphysical Society in Brooklyn andthe People\u2019s Church in New York. Americans came to knowSwamiji as it were anew and the same enthusiasm andappreciation that he had received in the glorious days of theParliament of Religions were again in evidence. He was called\u201cthe lightning orator,\u201d and his fame spread so rapidly in themetropolis that he rented at Madison Square Garden a hugehall, with a seating capacity of fifteen hundred, for his secondseries of lectures which he commenced during February. Thesubjects were \u201cBhakti Yoga\u201d, \u201cThe Real and the ApparentMan\u201d, and \u201cMy Master, Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa\u201d \u2014the last-mentioned lecture being delivered on 24 February,which happened also to be the date of the public celebration ofSri Ramakrishna\u2019s birthday celebrations in India, and closedthe series. In February Swami Vivekananda also deliveredlectures before the Metaphysical Society at Hartford inConnecticut, a State lying just to the south of Massachusettsand also before the Ethical Society of Brooklyn. During thewhile, as we know from a letter from Swami Kripananda dated3 January 1896, Swamis Abhayananda and Kripananda hadbegun to assist him. The former held wellattended classes onthe Vedanta philosophy in Brooklyn  and the latter taughtlessons on Raja Yoga and Bhakti Yoga to classes of beginnersat headquarters. 47A fitting result of his strenuous activities of this periodwas the initiation by him into sannyasa of Dr. Street, a devoutdisciple, who received the name of Swami Yogananda. At theimpressive ceremony of initiation, 13 January 1896, the othersannyasis and brahmacharis were gathered. In the followingweek, a number of young men and women took mantras ,106720 January 1896. The Press regarded these events as \u201cone ofthe Swami\u2019s powerful influence for good\u201d over those who cameinto personal contact with him. The fact that three Americans,representing learning, position and culture, embraced sannyasawithin one year showed what his teachings could do in theland of worldly enjoyment. On 17 February, Swamiji wrote toAlasinga, \u201cI have succeeded now in rousing the very heart ofAmerican civilization.\u201d 48 This was not an empty boast. Manypeople who had been only admirers had now become hispersonal disciples and expressed a strong desire to be initiatedby him into brahmacharya. Thousands had heard his messageand appreciated it and they called themselves Vedantins. TheSwami was highly gratified that his desire of reaching the peoplewas fulfilled.An important outcome of Swamiji\u2019s private and publiclectures was the production of a number of works embodyinghis thoughts that have helped to spread them throughout theworld in later days. This was just as he himself desired. On10 December 1895 he wrote to Mrs. Bull, \u201cI have begun towrite in earnest, as I want to finish some textbooks to form thebasis of work when I am gone. I have to hurry through fourlittle books before I go.\u201d 49 His treatise on the Karma Yoga waspublished in February, 1896. The second work, Raja Yoga, waspublished in England in July of the same year. About itspublication  there was an unfortunate misunderstandingbetween his English and American disciples. Sister Devamatahas said about it as follows, \u201cWhen the manuscript of the RajaYoga was completed, it was entrusted to Miss Waldo to put itinto print but many distresses and heartaches lay in wait forher before publication was accomplished. Another devotedfollower of the Swami borrowed the manuscript, carried it toLondon and brought it out there, believing it as to the Swami\u2019sORGANISING THE AMERICAN WORKSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1068advantage to have it appear in England. For the time thisblocked the American edition and it was only possible to havean American edition by adding the Glossary and other matters.\u201d50 As we have seen, Bhakti Yoga was originally publishedserially in the Brahmavadin . It was printed as a book in Madrasin the autumn. As regards the lectures on Jnana Yoga, there areevidences that Miss Waldo had noted them down. She speaksabout her notes in her letter to Mrs. Ole Bull dated 19 May1896. As we have said above, the lectures delivered on thesubject in America were, according to Miss Waldo, neverpublished, those to be found in the work known as Jnana Yogahaving been delivered in England and India. 51 (They wereactually delivered in England and America.) However, whenSwami Saradananda was in America, he got copies made ofSwamiji\u2019s \u201cDiscourses on Jnana Yoga\u201d from the manuscript ofMiss Waldo. This is to be found in C. W . 52 and probablycontains the essence of the lectures delivered on Jnana Yoga inAmerica. The American journals received and reviewed theseworks favourably and in particular, Raja Yoga, which alsoaroused a considerable discussion among the psychologists andphysiologists of the leading Universities. 53 About this work,Swami Abhedananda later said that he met many people inAmerica who regarded it in the same light as the most ardentChristian regarded his own Bible. 54Having finished his work in New York, SwamiVivekananda went on his third visit to Detroit, (3 March 1896),the story of which we have already narrated in Chapter 8 above.From Detroit Swamiji returned to Boston, where he deliveredfour lectures for the Procopeia Club at the Allen Gymnasium,with constant audiences of between four and five hundredpeople. 55 His next appearance, which was one of the mostremarkable incidents of his whole American career, was before1069the graduate students of Harvard University on 25 March 1896.Swamiji was fairly known to the students\u2019 circles of thisUniversity where his friend, Dr. Wright, was Professor of Greekand as early as 16 May 1894 had delivered a lecture there underthe auspices of the Harvard Union, his subject probably being\u201cThe Manners and Customs of India\u201d. Then again, when inDecember 1894 he was staying at Mrs. Bull\u2019s Cambridge homeas her guest and holding daily parlour classes on Vedanta, thestudents of Harvard University attended them, finding in themhelps to the solution of philosophical problems that they hadto tackle in their courses of study. The invitation that he receivedearly in 1896 from Mr. John P. Fox (probably the same youngman who had acted as his Secretary when he was staying atMrs. Bull\u2019s home as a guest and later lived with him for sometime in London) was a tribute to his eminence as a philosopheras well as to his fame as a religious preacher. The lecture thathe delivered there on the \u201cPhilosophy of the Vedanta\u201d(popularly known as the Harvard Lecture) was a masterlypresentation of the whole range of philosophical thought whichgoes by the generic name of Vedanta. At the end of the lecturethere were Questions and Answers in the course of whichSwamiji gave, extempore, short but illuminating elucidationsof topics arising out of the lecture. 56 The University offeredhim a Chair of Eastern Philosophy, which he could not acceptas a sannyasin.The Harvard professors were deeply impressed with thebeauty and elevation of Indian philosophy, which they thoughtwas of a highly moral and emotional rather than of a purelyintellectual character. In an introduction to the pamphletembodying the address, the Rev. C. C. Everett, D. D., L1.D. ofHarvard University, spoke as follows, \u201cI have seen a pamphletfilled with speeches made at a large and influential meeting atTHE HARVARD LECTURESWAMI VIVEKANANDA1070Calcutta, which was called together to express enthusiasticapproval of the manner in which he (Swami Vivekananda) hasfulfilled his mission and satisfaction at this invasion of the Westby Oriental thought. This satisfaction is well grounded. Wemay not be so near to actual conversion as some of thesespeakers believe; but Vivekananda has created a high degreeof interest in his work. It is a rare pleasure to see a form ofbelief that to most seems so far away and unreal as the Vedantasystem, represented by an actually living and extremelyintelligent believer. This system is not to be regarded merelyas a curiosity, as a speculative vagary. Hegel said that Spinozismis the necessary beginning of all philosophizing. This can besaid even more emphatically of the Vedanta system. WeOccidentals busy ourselves with the manifold. We can have,however, no understanding of the manifold, if we have no senseof the One in which the manifold exists. The reality of the Oneis the truth which the East will teach us; and we owe a debt ofgratitude to Vivekananda that he has taught this lesson soeffectively.\u201dThe questions that were asked at the end of the lecturedrew illuminating elucidations of the Swami\u2019s observations,as we have said above. The Swami was asked whether therewas an antagonism between Vedanta thought and the Westernsciences. The Swami, denying that there was any, stated thatthe theory of evolution was found in Patanjali\u2019s Yoga Sutras,which speak of one species being changed into another by theInfilling of nature \u2014 jatyantaraparinamah prakrityapurat . Theonly difference, he pointed out, lay in the explanation, \u2014 thatof Patanjali being spiritual \u2014 nimittaprayojakam prakritinamvaranabhedastu tatah kshetrikavat . Just as when a farmerwants to water his field from the canals that pass near, he hasonly to lift up his gate, said Patanjali, so each man is the infinitealready, only these bars and bolts and different circumstances1071shut him in. But as soon as they are removed, he rushes outand expresses himself. \u201cIn the animal,\u201d said Swamiji, \u201cthe manwas held in abeyance but as soon as good circumstances came,he was manifested as man. And again, as soon as fittingcircumstances came, the God in man manifested itself.\u201dAsked about the Vedantic idea of civilization, SwamiVivekananda said as follows, \u201cYou are philosophers and youdo not think that a bag of gold makes the difference betweenman and man. What is the value of all these machines andsciences? They have only one result; they spread knowledge.You have not solved the problem of want, but only made itkeener. Machines do not solve the poverty question; they simplymake men struggle the more. Competition gets keener. Whatvalue has nature in itself? Why do you go and build a monumentto a man who sends electricity through a wire? Does not naturedo that millions of times over? Is not everything already existingin nature? What is the value of your getting it? It is alreadythere. The only value is that it makes this development. Thisuniverse is simply a gymnasium in which the soul is takingexercises and after these exercise we become gods. So the valueof everything is to be decided by how far it is a manifestationof God. Civilization is the manifestation of that divinity in man.\u201dThat land, he added, 57 is the most civilized wherein the highestideals become practical. At this time, as we have said above, Swami Vivekanandawas studying Sanskrit philosophical works with their differentbhashyas (commentaries). He found in the latter so much of\u201ctext torturing\u201d that he would often go deep into himself andcome out with new light and interpretation. To find out thetrue meaning of the texts in their later incrustation was asdifficult as the task of presenting them to Westerners. Swamijifound that another difficulty lay in the logical forms of IndianVEDANTA FOR WESTERNERSSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1072philosophy, which Westerners might well call in question, andso he set about the further task of reorganizing Hindu logic aswell. No better instance of this reorganizing tendency is morenoticeable than in some of his replies to questions at Harvard.Asked, for example, \u201cWhy does Maya or Ignorance exist?\u201dSwamiji replied, \u201c`Why\u2019 cannot be asked beyond the limit ofcausation. It can only be asked within Maya. We say we willanswer the question when it is logically formulated. Beforethat we have no right to answer.\u201d Asked then if the PersonalGod belonged to Maya, Swamiji said, \u201cYes, but the PersonalGod is the same Absolute seen through Maya.\u201d Asked howVedanta explained the relation between individuality and ethics,Swamiji said, \u201cThe real individual is the Absolute, thispersonalization is through Maya. It is only apparent; in realityit is always the Absolute. In reality there is one, but in Maya itis appearing as many. In Maya there is this variation. Yet evenin this Maya there is always the tendency to get back to theOne, as expressed in all ethics and all morality of every nation,because it is the constitutional necessity of the soul. It is findingits oneness; and this struggle to find this oneness is what wecall ethics and morality. Therefore we must always practisethem.\u201dIt appears that it was when he came to Cambridge todeliver his lecture before the University that he stayed for afew days with Mrs. Ole Bull as her guest (and not at the end ofDecember, 1895). This is indicated by the fact that he wrote aletter to Alasinga from Boston on 23 March 1896 and by strayreferences in the papers 58 that he delivered some lectures inthe city. According to The New York Herald (date not mentionedin the excerpt) Swami Vivekananda was invited to speak beforethe Dixon Society (before which the reader will recall, he haddelivered a lecture in April, 1895 on an earlier visit) by1073Dr. Wright. According to the paper, many clergymen attendedhis lecture. About his other lectures at Boston, we learnsomething from the following in The Boston Transcript : \u201cTheSwami Vivekananda has, during the past few days, conducteda most successful work in connection with the Procopeia.During this time he has given four class lectures for the Clubitself, with constant audiences of between four and five hundredpeople, at the Allen Gymnasium, 44, St. Botolph Street, two atthe house of Mrs. Ole Bull in Cambridge, and one before theprofessors and graduate students of the philosophicaldepartment of Harvard University. . . .One of his lectures duringthis week has been The Ideal of a Universal Religion .\u201d Thejournal also said that Swamiji was the guest of the TwentiethCentury Club on Saturday (the date cannot be ascertained) andthat he was leaving Boston \u201ctoday\u201d and was due to sail forEngland en route to India within a few days.There was a veritable rediscovery of Swami Vivekanandain American newspapers, as we have said above, andencomiums were lavished on him in a manner that remindedone of the high praises bestowed on him in the days of theParliament of Religions. About his lecture at Hartford on \u201cSouland God\u201d, the Hartford Daily Times wrote, \u201cHis views are morein consonance with those of Christ than those of many so-calledChristians.\u201d The New York Herald , the leading paper of NewYork, mentioning Swami Vivekananda\u2019s work in the later partof January, 1896, said, \u201cSwami Vivekananda is a name toconjure with in certain circles of New York society of today \u2014and those not the least wealthy, or intellectual. It is borne by adusky gentleman from India, who for the last twelve monthshas been making name and fame for himself in this metropolisby the propagation of certain forms of Oriental religion,philosophy and practice. . .Sufficient success has attended theTHE HARVARD LECTURESWAMI VIVEKANANDA1074efforts of Swami Vivekananda.\u201d Writing to the Brahmavadin ,Helen Huntingdon said that Swamiji\u2019s influence had \u201calreadygrown into a deep, strong undercurrent of spiritual awakening\u201din America. According to Swami Kripananda, the \u201cmostpalpable manifestation of Swamiji\u2019s influence on the religiousthought was shown in the growing demand for Vedanticliterature and the frequent use of Sanskrit terms, such as Atman,Purusha, Prakriti, Moksha by people from whom one wouldleast expect to hear them.\u201d \u201cThe names of Sankaracharya andRamanuja,\u201d continued he, \u201care becoming with many almost asfamiliar as Huxley and Spencer. The public libraries are runningafter everything that has references to India: the books of MaxMuller, Colebrooke, Deussen, Burnouf, and of all the authorsthat have ever been written in English on Hindu philosophy,find a ready sale; and even the dry and tiresome Schopenhauer,on account of his Vedantic background, is being studied withgreat eagerness.\u201d He concluded a letter to the Brahmavadin ,from which the above has been quoted, in a half humorousway: \u201cBy the way India had at once better make clear her titleto the ownership of the Swami. They are about to write hisbiography for the National Encyclopedia of the United Statesof America, thus making of him an American citizen. The timemay come when as seven cities disputed with each other forthe honour of having given birth to Homer (through the streetsof which he had begged for a piece of bread), seven countriesmay claim our Master as  theirs, and thus rob India of the honourof producing one of the noblest of her children.\u201dWhat beneficent influence Swamiji\u2019s personality andphilosophy had on the personal life of herself as well as of herhusband, both of whom chanced to listen to some of his lecturesin New York at this time has been described in a most feelingmanner by Mrs. Ella Wheeler Wilcox, one of the foremost1075poetesses of America and one of the most representative womenof the world. What she wrote on the subject to the New YorkAmerican on 26 May 1907 is worth quoting in extenso . \u201cTwelveyears ago,\u201d said she, \u201cI chanced one evening to hear that acertain teacher of philosophy from India, a man namedVivekananda, was to lecture a block from my home in NewYork. We went out of curiosity (the Man whose name I bearand I), and before we had been ten minutes in the audience wefelt ourselves lifted up into an atmosphere so rarefied, so vital,so wonderful, that we sat spellbound and almost breathless, tothe end of the lecture. When it was over we went out with newcourage, new hope, new strength, and new faith, to meet life\u2019sdaily vicissitudes. `This is the Philosophy, this is the idea ofGod, the religion which I have been seeking,\u2019 said the Man.And for months afterwards he went with me to hear SwamiVivekananda explain the old religion, and to gather from hiswonderful mind jewels of truth and thoughts of helpfulnessand strength. It was that terrible winter of financial disasters,when banks failed and stocks went down like broken balloonsand business men walked through the dark valleys of despairand the whole world seemed topsy-turvy \u2014 one just such anera as we are again approaching. Sometimes after sleeplessnights of worry and anxiety, the Man would go on with me tohear the Swami lecture, and then he would come out into thewinter gloom and walk down the street smiling and say, `It\u2019sall right. There is nothing to worry over.\u2019 And  I would go backto my own duties and pleasures with the same uplifted senseof soul and enlarged vision. When any philosophy, any religion,can do this for human beings in this age of stress and strain,and when, added to this, it intensifies their faith in God andincreases their sympathies for their kind and gives them aconfident joy in the thought of other lives to come, it is a goodand great religion.\u201dTHE HARVARD LECTURESWAMI VIVEKANANDA1076New York, April 6 18951077Thousand Island Park, July 1895SWAMI VIVEKANANDA1078Thousand Island Park, July 18951079London, 1895SWAMI VIVEKANANDA1080IVIn response to many urgent calls from London and partlybecause he was in poor health and badly needed a changeSwamiji left New York for London on 5 April 1896 aboardThe White Star Line Germanic . 59 This time the voyage waspleasant and there was no sickness, he giving himself sometreatment to avoid it, as he wrote to the Hale Sisters on reachingLondon. It was a pleasant surprise to find that the \u201cotherSwami,\u201d his gurubhai Saradananda whom, by the way, he hadnot seen for the last six years, had already arrived and wasputting up with Mr. Sturdy. His brother, Mahendra, had alsocome to London for his studies, having brought with him thefamous Sanskrit encyclopedia, the Vachaspatyabhidhana , ashe had desired. At Mr. Sturdy\u2019s house, Swamiji immediatelyplunged into philosophical studies and discussions and alsogot himself busy editing books. As he wrote to the Hale Sisters,\u201cI. . .now am once more in Reading amidst Brahma and Mayaand Jiva, the individual and the universal, etc.\u201d 60 About SwamiSaradananda he wrote, \u201cHe is one of the nicest of men I see,and is quite a learned monk too.\u201d 61 About him he also wrote toMiss Alberta Sturges a little later as follows, \u201cPoor man! \u2014 atypical Hindu with nothing of that pluck and go which I have,he is always dreamy and gentle and sweet! That won\u2019t do. Iwill try to put a little activity into him.\u201d 62It was a long time since Swamiji had received somefirsthand information about the affairs in the Alambazar Mathwhich, on account of differences of opinion among some of itsmembers, was not running quite smoothly. In the midst of allhis strenuous labours and worries, from far off America, he,argus-eyed, was keeping watch over his gurubhais, remindingthem about their latent powers \u2014 now praising them for any1081good work that he heard they were doing and then scoldingthem if he found any of them meriting his anger but alwaysgiving them good advice and plans for work. Once in angerand disgust he had written a severe letter to SwamiSaradananda, 23 December 1895. He had said, \u201cYour letteronly made me sad. I see you have lost all enthusiasm. I knowall of you, your powers and limitations. I would not have calledyou to any task which you are incompetent to do.\u201d Then,referring to a gurubhai (Baikunthanath Sanyal) who, it seems,had taken some money from him on the plea that it was neededfor a lawsuit and then used it for marrying his infant daughter,he said, \u201cTell Sanyal that I am not at all angry with him, but Iwas sorry, very sorry. It is not the money \u2014 that counts nothingbut the violation of a principle that pained me and the trick heplayed on me. Goodbye to him also and to you all. One chapterof my life is closed. Let others come in their due order. . . . Iwant no help from any human being in any country. So goodbye!May the Lord bless you all for ever and ever.\u201d 63 In anotherletter addressed to his brother monks at the Math, however, hehandsomely acknowledged their services to the cause. Hewrote, \u201cTo tell you the truth, I do not find among you anydistinction of great or small; everyone has the capacity tomanifest, in times of need, the highest energy.\u201d Then, namingSasi, Kali, Jogen, Niranjan, Hari, Tulasi, Gupta, Baburam andSarat (Swamis respectively named Ramakrishnananda,Abhedananda, Yogananda, Niranjanananda, Turiyananda,Nirmalananda, Sadananda, Premananda, and Saradananda) andmentioning and eulogizing the work done by each, he exhortedthem as follows, \u201cHe (Sri Ramakrishna) is at the helm, whatfear! You are all of infinite strength \u2014 how long does it takeyou keep off petty jealousy or egotistic ideas! The momentsuch propensity comes, resign yourselves to the Lord! Just makeover our body and mind to His work, and all troubles will be atan end forever.\u201d 64AMERICAN \u201cRE-DISCOVERY\u201d OF  SWAMIJISWAMI VIVEKANANDA1082From what Swami Saradananda had to tell him aboutthe affairs of the Math, Swamiji was far from reassured thathis gurubhais had parted with petty jealousy and egotistic ideasand resigned themselves to the Lord alone. He lost no time indevising ways and means for remedying the situation and in aletter to Swami Ramakrishnananda, who was one of his mostdependable gurubhais, 65 he gave an elaborate plan on whichthe Math should be reorganized and laying down stringent rulesfor the conduct of its inmates. He prefaced them with theobservations, \u201cIt is not for gaining personal authority that I dothis, but for your good, and for fulfilling the purpose for whichthe Lord came. He gave me the charge of you all, and you shallcontribute to the great wellbeing of the world \u2014 though mostof you are not aware of it. . . . No doubt it is an evil to be boundby laws, but it is necessary at the immature stage to be guidedby rules; in other words, as the Master used to say that thesapling must be hedged around, and so on.\u201dAfter writing something on how the Math should bemanaged, he outlined a constitution for it. He wanted that thereshould be a Governing Body and after setting forth itscomposition, suggested that Swami Brahmananda should bethe President that year. The other members of the GoverningBody should be the Secretary, and a third member to superintendthe worship, etc. He suggested that the Math should have threedepartments, as follows \u2014 (I) Study, (II) Propaganda. (III)Religious Practice. He directed that all the office-bearers shouldbe elected \u201cas was the mandate of Lord Buddha,\u201d but suggestedthat that year Swami Brahmananda should be President, SwamiNirmalananda Secretary and Treasurer, Sadananda, Librarian,and Swami Ramakrishnananda, Abhedananda, Turiyananda,and Trigunatitananda should take charge of the teaching andpreaching work by turns. He said, \u201cIf you consider it wise to1083be guided by my ideas and if you follow these rules, then Ishall supply you all necessary funds. Otherwise, I shall cutmyself off from you all completely.\u201d 66With his mind fairly at ease about the future working ofthe Alambazar Math, Swamiji now threw himself heart andsoul into the work which had brought him to London. Afterstaying for about a week at Mr. Sturdy\u2019s house Swamiji andSwami Saradananda went to Pinkineys Green, a village somethree miles from Maiden head Station, where Miss Muller hadher country residence. Mahendra followed them there after afew days while Mr. Goodwin continued to stay in London. HereSwamiji received the sad news of the death of Satya, the youngson of Swami Brahmananda. He was, however, comforted tolearn that Swami Brahmananda had daily visited his son duringthe days of his illness and that all arrangements for his propertreatment had been made. After a few days\u2019 stay at the village,during which Swamiji had some real rest in body and mind,they returned to London where Mr. Sturdy had rented a houseat 63, St. George\u2019s Road, Belgravia, which belonged to LadyMargesson, for their joint stay. Swamiji occupied a room withan attached bathroom on the ground floor, and held classes ina well decorated room on the first floor which couldaccommodate about one hundred and fifty persons. SwamiSaradananda and Mahendra lived in a big room on the thirdfloor, while Mr. Goodwin occupied the garret, which hadremained unused for a long time and was full of fleas. MissMuller lived in a room on the second floor.In the beginning of May 1896, Swamiji opened his lectureclasses at St. George\u2019s Road with the intention (as we learnfrom his letter to Alberta, referred to above) of continuing themfor four or five months, after which he wanted to return toCONSTITUTION FOR THE ALAMBAZAR MATHSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1084India. The lectures, which were on Raja Yoga, were deliveredevery Tuesday and Thursday, both in the morning and in theevening - once at 11 a.m. and again, for the benefit of thosewho could not attend them, in the evening at 8 or 8.30 p.m. Inthe mornings, the audience consisted of more women than men,the latter, however, being quite a number. As the number ofstudents went on increasing, Swamiji opened a question class,which he held every Friday at 8.30 p.m. Among those whoattended regularly, Mahendranath Datta67 particularly mentionsMiss Josephine MacLeod, her elder sister, Mrs. Leggett, anotherlady aged about 50-55 who came with a leashed dog and wassaid to be the wife of a \u201cgeneral,\u201d being obviously Mrs. Sevier,Mr. and Mrs. B.L. Gupta, Mr. K.G. Gupta, Canon Haweis withhis wife and daughter, an old lady from Sydenham and a womendressed as a nurse, who never spoke a word with anybody andtook down notes of the lectures in shorthand. Swamiji spokeas if inspired and, as was his wont, put his whole soul into histeaching in giving out his realizations. Writing about theseclasses, the Queen commented as follows: \u201cIt is a great wonder,indeed, that the Swami has been able to attract, from the verycommencement of the course of his Lectures, so many men ina materialistic society like London, where none cares a fig forreligion, while politics reigns supreme in the minds of thepeople, especially now at the time of the London Season - theseason of balls, feasts and all sorts of entertainments.\u201d68The success of the lecture classes encouraged his friendsto arrange for the opening of a series of lectures in one of thegalleries of the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours, inPiccadilly. The subjects were \u201cThe Necessity of Religion\u201d,\u201cA Universal Religion\u201d, and \u201cThe Real and the Apparent Man\u201d.These lectures, which were delivered on Sundays, were viewedwith disfavour by the padres, who wrote in their papers that a1085certain atheist had come from India to preach religion, that hedecried Christianity, etc. The result was that thoughMr. Goodwin sent notices of the lectures for publication underthe Church News columns, the newspapers refused to publishthem. 69 The lectures, nevertheless, were highly successful, somuch so that another course, which was earnestly sought, wasarranged in Princes\u2019 Hall for Sunday afternoons beginning fromthe end of June and continuing until the middle of July. Amongthese lectures, according to The Life , were \u201cBhakti Yoga\u201d,\u201cRenunciation\u201d, and \u201cRealization\u201d. According toMahendranath Datta, the class lectures delivered at St. George\u2019sRoad were on Raja Yoga and the series of lectures at Piccadillywere later published in book form as \u201cJnana Yoga\u201d, etc.What has been described above by no means coveredthe whole, or even the major part of the Swami\u2019s activities inEngland at this time. Of much of it there is no recordwhatsoever, though its results must have been substantial andeven far-reaching. Mahendranath Datta says that Swamiji rarelylunched at home, being taken away to their homes bydistinguished looking persons for lunching with them. He wouldbe made to stay on till teatime and have an afternoon walk intheir company, returning home at 9 p.m. One evening Swamijihad sat down for his meals at home and taken a few spoonfulsof food when he remembered he had an engagement at thehouse of a Duke, and hurriedly dressed himself and left. It goeswithout saying that he did not  accept these invitations becausehe wanted to get admitted into high society but because theyafforded him opportunities for talking with his hosts on Indianculture and philosophy. He used to tell his brother and Goodwin,\u201cI shall not leave the country till I succeed in injecting Vedantainto the very bones of these people.\u201d It is said that, besidesmembers of the nobility, even those of blood royal attendedLECTURES IN LONDONSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1086some of his lectures. He thus exercised an influence, intangiblethough it was, over the people of the highest classes in Englandwho generally refused to meet, except very formally sometimes,Indians, howsoever the latter were placed, and were thusimpervious to the higher thought and culture of the Indianpeople.Apart from his scheduled public and private lectures,Swamiji delivered lectures at many distinguished homes,drawing rooms, and several well-known clubs, of only a fewof which we have some record. We mention a few of thesemeetings, about which we learn from The Life , which has basedits narrative partly on his letters. At the invitation of Mrs. AnnieBesant, he spoke at her lodge in Avenue Road, St. John\u2019s wood,on Bhakti, to show his sympathy for all sects. Col. Olcott waspresent there. He also delivered a lecture on \u201cThe Hindu Ideaof Soul\u201d at the house of Mrs. Victor Biddulph Martin at one ofher receptions to meet Americans, where naturally many well-known faces were noticed. It was here, it is said, that somemembers of the British royal family (the Duchess of Albany, adaughter-in-law of the Queen, being recognized by some inthe audience) were present, though strictly incognito . At theend of the lecture there were the usual Questions and Answers,which were \u201cas interesting as the address itself.\u201dSwamiji also spoke at Notting Hill Gate at the residenceof Mrs. Hunt. About this time he addressed a large meeting atWimbledon, when a good deal of helpful discussion followedthe lecture and several other meetings of a similar nature werearranged for. At the Sesame Club (of which Miss MargaretNoble, later Sister Nivedita, was the Secretary) he spoke on\u201cEducation\u201d. On the substance of this lecture, we have someinformation from an article by Swami Saradananda in the1087Brahmavadin of 6 June 1896. \u201cIn this,\u201d wrote the Swami, \u201chedealt with the old educational systems of India, pointed outclearly and impressively that the sole aim of the system was`man making\u2019 and not cramming, and compared it with thepresent system. He held that the mind of man is a reservoir ofknowledge, and that all knowledge, present, past, or future, iswithin man, manifested or nonmanifested, and the object ofevery system of education should be to help the mind to manifestit. For instance, the Law of Gravitation was within man, andthe fall of the apple helped Newton to think upon it and bringit out from within his mind.\u201d According to Mr. T. K. Desai,who contributed his reminiscences of Swami Vivekananda tothe Vedanta Kesari in 1932, Swamiji attended a meeting of theRoyal Asiatic Society of London, at which the celebratedhistorian and economist, Mr. R. C. Datta, I.C.S., was alsopresent 70 and Prof. Bain read a paper on the Upanishads.Swamiji did not speak there. Mr. Desai also says that Swamijipresided at a meeting of the London Hindu Association, atwhich Mr. Dadabhai Naoroji was also present. Swamiji madea speech that electrified the audience, though Mr. Desai doesnot tell us what he spoke about. Swamiji evidently was fond ofMr. Desai, and often took him to his residence, and once visitedhim while he was staying with the Owens.As in America, many words were said in England inpraise of Swami Vivekananda\u2019s personal appearance, his perfectcommand of the English language, and his wonderful oratory,besides appreciation of the beauty and originality of his thought.The  clergy generally were friendly to him, perhaps becausemost of them were disciplined by their membership of a StateChurch, 71 and he had many personal friends among the highdignitaries of the Anglican clergy. Canon Haweis, about whomwe have spoken above, and who as a sort of a delegate to theLECTURES IN LONDONSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1088Parliament of Religions from the Anglican Church, had knownand admired Swamiji since then, preached two sermons at theSt. James\u2019 Chapel, London, on him. He spoke at length of thesupport that Swamiji\u2019s movements gave to Christ\u2019s teachings.Mr. Goodwin, who listened to one of the Canon\u2019s sermons at achurch at Regent Park, reported laughingly that it was all about\u201cByakti\u201d and \u201cByakto\u201d (Bhakti and Bhakta), but highly praisedit. He said that the Canon had fully acknowledged in his sermonhis indebtedness to Swami Vivekananda and had observed thatChristianity would benefit if it accepted his ideas (on bhaktiand bhakta). 72There were, however, some opposition and a fewdetractors \u2014 not all of them coming from the ranks of theclergy. As we have said above, due to clerical objections, thenewspapers were prevented from announcing Swamiji\u2019sengagements under Church News. Mr. Desai tells us that athis lecture at the Balloon Society, a clergyman got upimmediately after Swamiji had spoken and said that it wouldhave been better if the lecturer had taken the trouble to writeout his lecture at home and read it at the meeting. Swamiji gotup and made such a fiery speech that the clergyman wasnowhere. 73 We learn from the reminiscences of Mr. EricHammond 74 that at one of Swamiji\u2019s meetings, at the close ofhis address, a white-haired and well-known philosopher saidto the Swami, \u201cYou have spoken splendidly, Sir, and I thankyou heartily, but you have told us nothing new.\u201d Swamiji\u2019ssonorous tones rang through the room in reply, \u201cSir, I havetold you the Truth. That, the Truth, is as old as the immemorialhills, as old as humanity, as old as the Great God. If I have toldit in such words as will make you think, make you live up toyour thinking, do I not do well in telling?\u201d The murmur of\u201cHear! Hear!\u201d and the louder clapping of hands, wrote Mr. Eric1089Hammond, showed how completely the Swami had carriedthe audience with him.Sometimes too there were people in his audiences whohad come just to heckle him and produce confusion in themeetings. Some of the mischief-makers were retired civiliansfrom India, who as a class (there being honorable exceptions)were inimical to India\u2019s claims to better treatment from theGovernment. Mahendranath Datta has narrated one such story.75 Within a few minutes of the commencement of his lectureone evening, a retired civilian shouted at the top of his voice inderisory and distorted tones, \u201cOh, thank you!\u201d Others lookedat the direction from which the contemptuous remark camebut for the moment they kept silent and Swamiji went on withhis speech. But the Britisher shouted in the same kind ofintonation twice and thrice, \u201cOh, thank you!\u201d People nowbecame irritated, they cast glances at the man seated near thefireplace, who was causing the disturbance, but they maintainedoutward calmness. At the moment Swamiji was speaking onBuddha, his sacrifices and the nobility of his message of peace.Continuing to be at his seat near the fireplace, the man shouted,\u201cSir Monier Williams has said in his book that Buddha was avery selfish and cruel man, that he left his wife and son to theirfate and that he was an atheist. Buddhism cannot be countedas one among the religions, since Buddha had only laid downsome regulations for society, and there cannot be a religionwithout God.\u201d Swamiji paid no attention to what the man saidand went on with his speech, now dilating on Buddha\u2019s charity,and remarking that even at the present day India had saints ofthe highest order. The man shouted,  \u201cThat\u2019s not correct. Thesocalled saints are all thieves, just thieves. When these mencame to a town, I used to direct the police to keep a watch overtheir movements and sometimes have them driven out fromLECTURES IN LONDONSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1090London, 18951091London, 1895SWAMI VIVEKANANDA1092the villages with the help of the police. It is only thieves andcheats who put on gerua, and people consider all gerua cladmen to be sadhus.\u201dMr. Sturdy who was seated on a sofa in the rear of thehall came up to the centre in quick steps and said loudly andangrily, \u201cWhile I was in India I saw many sadhus and conversedwith them. They all were of the highest character, as is Swamijihimself.\u201d At this the man who had taken Swamiji to be aMadrasi since there were many Madrasi doctors living in Bowbazar Street in Calcutta who treated patients suffering frompiles, and bore names ending in the word \u201cSwami\u201d, assumed apatronizing manner, and in the same kind of distorted tone ofvoice, addressed some words directly to Swamiji. \u201cI thought,\u201dsaid he, \u201cyou were a Madrasi, now I see you are a BengaliBabu. You know that during the Mutiny we saved you.\u201dMr. Sturdy, who had resumed his seat, ran up again to the centreand said in a terribly loud voice, \u201cBut you were well paid forit.\u201d He was trembling in ungovernable rage, was inclined toturn the man out of the room and, undecided about it, and beganto whirl his arms to and fro. Mr. Goodwin, who was quietlytaking down notes in shorthand and casting angry glances nowand then at the man, lost his patience and, tucking up his sleeves,made himself ready for fisting the man. He was waiting onlyfor Swamiji to finish his lecture to do so. Swami Saradanandaand Mahendra, wondering what might befall them in a foreign,strange land, trembled in fear.Swamiji, who was going on with his lecture withoutcaring for what the man was saying, now discarded his usualplacid appearance and assumed frightful looks. He turned hisside to  the right and looking in the direction of the fireplacewhere the man was seated, spoke in words of fire continuously1093for about thirty-five minutes. He traced the whole history ofthe English people from the days of Hengist and Horsa (middleof the fifth century A.D.) to modern times and spoke of theterror and devastation that they had carried to other lands,quoting throughout this narration facts and figures from historyto support it. The audience listened spellbound, wondering whatwas more marvellous \u2014 whether it was his mastery of history,or his ability to marshal historical facts to formulate animpeachment. Then that Englishman, finding himself thuspublicly humiliated, began to weep and taking out ahandkerchief from his pocket began repeatedly to blow his nose.Three handkerchiefs were thus soiled one after another andreplaced in his pocket. After thirty-five minutes Swamiji turnedhis face again in the direction of the audience, and, in a softand gentle voice, said, \u201cNow we come to Pratyahara andDharana. . .\u201d Yogi like he stood still and continued with hislecture, beginning with where he had stopped previously. Therewere, however, no Questions and Answers that evening. Whenhis lecture ended, many among the audience stood up and said,\u201cSwamiji, you have taught us a grand lesson in forbearance.\u201dWe have to mention that that Englishman also showed thatSwamiji\u2019s words had not been in vain for him. At the end ofthe lecture he quietly walked up to Mr. Sturdy, uttered a wordof apology, and hastily left the place.Englishmen like the one above described were not quiteso contemptible as this blooming Anglo-Indian ex-civilianmade himself at Swamiji\u2019s meeting. He represented a powerfulsection among the governing classes of Great Britian to whomSwamiji and his mission were as much of an anathema as theywere to the missionaries. If by exalting Hinduism Swamiji wasdisproving the case of the missionaries as to the need ofspreading the  gospel among the heathens, by awakening theANGLO-INDIAN OPPOSITION TO SWAMIJI\u2019S WORKSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1094national feeling of his downtrodden fellow countrymen, he wassimilarly though not quite palpably undermining Britishauthority in India of which these Anglo-Indian civilians werethe strongest pillars. At the time of Swamiji the nationalistthreat to British power in India was not clearly understood bythe masses of Britishers, which fact partially accounted for thekind reception and treatment that Indians met with in England.But the Anglo-Indian civilians had sensed the danger and passedon their reading of the Indian political situation to their mastersat home, the imperialist minded British politicians, whobelonged to all parties but were more numerous among theConservatives. So far as England, or for that matter Europe asa whole, was concerned, the times were of deepening crisisand opportunism was giving place to principles in every sphereof life. Europe was on the brink of a precipice, or on a volcano,as Swamiji clearly saw, and he thought that a disaster mightonly be averted if it accepted the teachings of Vedanta. Thatwas why, as we have seen above, he said that he was determinedto inject Vedanta into the very bones of the British people. Theimperialists, who trusted in chariots, either turned their deafears to, or opposed him and the Anglo-Indian ex-civilian whoapparently made a fool of himself in Swamiji\u2019s meeting wasone of a class that encamped with them.However, the land that had produced a Shakespeare anda Newton, and many other giants of the intellect and also ofthe spirit, still had, even in that age of materialist advance andspiritual decline, great minds with whom Swamiji was incommunion during his visits. As we have seen, his lectureswere attended by men of the highest standing and belonging toall walks of life. Canon Wilberforce invited him to his residence,where he held a levee in his honour, in which manydistinguished ladies and gentlemen took part. What, however,1095Swamiji considered as a rare privilege was to be invited byProf. Max Muller to his residence at Oxford and to conversewith him on many subjects of Indian philosophy and, aboveall, on his master, Sri Ramakrishna. On his visit to the Professoron 28 May 1896, Swamiji spoke as follows in an article in theBrahmavadin on 6 June 1896, \u201cWhat an extraordinary man isProf. Max Muller! I paid a visit to him a few days ago. I shouldsay that I went to pay my respects to him, for whosoever lovesSri Ramakrishna, my visit to that person I hold as a pilgrimage.\u201dHis description of his visit to Max Muller is a masterpieceof literary composition and eloquence. \u201cThat nice little house,its setting in a beautiful garden, the silver headed sage, with aface calm and benign, and forehead smooth as a child\u2019s in spiteof seventy winters, and every line in that face speaking of adeep-seated mine of spirituality somewhere behind; that noblewife, the helpmate of his life through this long and arduoustask of exciting interest, overriding opposition and contempt,and at last creating a respect for the thoughts of the sages ofancient India \u2014 the trees, the flowers, the calmness and theclear sky \u2014 all these sent me back in imagination to the gloriousdays of ancient India, the days of our Brahmarshis andRajarshis, the days of the great Vanaprasthas, the days ofArundhatis and Vasishthas.\u201d A few days earlier, on 30 May1896, he had written to Mrs. Ole Bull and Mary Hale,eulogizing the Professor and his love of India and Indianphilosophical thought. In both these letters he said, \u201cI wish Ihad half his love for India and the Vedanta.\u201d 76 The Professortold Swamiji that he had contributed an article to the NineteenthCentury on Sri Ramakrishna (it appeared in that magazine inits issue of August). He had been set to thinking about the saintby what he thought were \u201csudden and momentous changes inthe life of Keshub Chandra Sen as the result of the latter\u2019sSWAMIJI MEETS MAX MULLERSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1096contact with him,\u201d he told Swamiji. He asked, \u201cWhat are youdoing to make him known to the world?\u201d 77 He said he wasprepared to write a fuller account of the life and teaching ofSri Ramakrishna, provided materials were supplied to him.Swamiji immediately wrote to Swami Ramakrishnananda, 24June 1896, asking him to collect the materials and send themdirectly to the Professor. According to The Life , 78 hecommissioned Swami Saradananda to do so.The product of the joint labours of the disciples ofSri Ramakrishna and Prof. Max Muller was a tiny work whichis nevertheless worth its weight in gold, from the latter\u2019s pen,\u201cThe Life and Sayings of Sri Ramakrishna,\u201d dealing, as thetitle suggests, with the sayings (which cover the greater part ofthe book) as well as the biography of the saint. 79 As his earlierarticle in the Nineteenth Century had aroused much criticism,on the score both of alleged inaccuracy as to facts andoverestimation of the saint\u2019s personality, from the Christianmissionaries and the Brahmos (Pratap Chandra Majumdaragain), the Professor had this time taken special pains to beabove reproach as to both. The Professor admitted that theremight be \u201ctraces of what I call the Dialogic Process and theirrepressible miraculizing tendencies of devoted disciples,\u201deven in \u201chis unvarnished description of the Master.\u201d (TheDialogic Process is the transformation produced in thedescription of the facts as they really happened, by too muchfavorableness or unfavourableness of the narrator towardsthem.)But he emphatically refuted the charges which Majumdarhad brought against Sri Ramakrishna, to wit, that he was oftenobscene in language, that his treatment of his wife was\u201cbarbarous,\u201d because he did not procreate children, that he did1097not express sufficient abhorrence of prostitutes and drunkards,and the crowning and the most absurd charge, that he did not\u201clive maritalment \u201c all his life. These charges, we may observe,ill  became Pratap Chandra Majumdar to make, for they wereutterly ridiculous and also because (as we have pointed out anumber of times earlier) he knew about these \u201cimperfections\u201dof Sri Ramakrishna when he repaired more than once toDakshineswar to sit at his feet and listen to his nectarine wordsand he had actually paid a glowing tribute to the saint in anarticle in the Indian Theistic Quarterly . On second thoughts,with a view to dispelling any doubts that any of our readersmay have concerning their nature, we give here brieflyProf. Max Muller\u2019s observations on them. Firstly,Sri Ramakrishna spoke in homely, colloquial language,sometimes using words which are generally not used in polishedsociety. They were by no means obscene and were devoid ofthe least breath of sensualism \u2014 being rather enjoyable as healways spoke with childlike simplicity. Secondly,Sri Ramakrishna took the vow of sannyasa with the consent ofhis wife, who passed her days in infinite bliss and peace in theservice of God as a lifelong brahmacharini. \u201cIs love betweenhusband and wife really impossible without the procreation ofchildren?\u201d the Professor asked. Thirdly, with regard to hisattitude to prostitutes, said the Professor, Sri Ramakrishna \u201cdoesnot stand quite alone among the founders of religion.\u201d Thesewords remind us of Buddha\u2019s treatment of Ambapali and thatof Christ to the Samaritan woman. As to them and drunkards,one wonders if it is saint like to drive off all sinners and ministerto the spiritual needs of decent people only. The fifth charge isalready answered in connection with the third one. 80Max Muller\u2019s little book on Sri Ramakrishna and hisearlier article in the Nineteenth Century helped SwamiSWAMIJI MEETS MAX MULLERSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1098Vivekananda in carrying on his work in England, since itaroused a considerable interest in the personality and teachingsof the fountainhead of the movement. They were frequently incorrespondence with each other and fast friends. Max Muller\u2019srole in popularizing  Sri Ramakrishna and helping the Vedantamovement inaugurated by Swamiji should not, however, beexaggerated. In 1896, when Swamiji first met him, he was 73,and had given the world all his greatest productions in Indology,Comparative Philology, and the Science of Religion. His handswere still full, and he was in a desperate hurry to completeediting the remaining volumes of The Sacred Books of the East\u2014 a task he had commenced in 1875, and which he had bythen nearly completed. (The series bearing the name was of 51volumes, of which three were published after his death.) It wasnot for him at this time to pioneer anything new. Even so, sofar as Sri Ramakrishna was concerned, he was not the firstEnglishman (born a German he had been naturalized inEngland) who wrote about him. Mr. C. H. Tawney, who wasPrincipal at the Presidency College, Calcutta, and was at thetime the Librarian of the British Museum, and is stillremembered by Indian scholars for his monumental translationof the Kathasaritsagara , was indeed the first Englishman towrite about the saint in an English periodical. In January, 1896he had contributed an article, entitled \u201cA Modern Hindu Saint,\u201dto The Imperial and Asiatic Quarterly Review and Orientaland Colonial Record . (A copy of a reprint of the article by S.C. Mitra, referred to by us above in the previous Chapter, hasrecently come into our possession through the courtesy of hisbrother, Sri Bholanath Mitra.) It purported to be a review of acollection of Sri Ramakrishna\u2019s Sayings by a Bengali writer,and contained an assessment of the importance of the saint tothe modern world. Principal Tawney pointed out thatSri Ramakrishna had profoundly influenced his educated fellow1099countrymen and that his teachings helped one to understand\u201cthe seriously minded Hindus\u201d much better than \u201cvolumes oftravels written by gentlemen who rush through India at railwayspeed and associate only with European officials orEuropeanized  natives of the boot and pantaloon type reprobatedby the Bengali saint.\u201dBorn at the ducal State of Dessau (Germany) in 1823,Max Muller (Friedrich Maximillian) matriculated in 1841 atthe University of Leipzig, where his keenness of intellect drewthe notice of Prof. Brockhaus, who induced him to take upSanskrit. Bopp, at Berlin (1844), made the Sanskrit student ascientific comparative philologist. Schelling at the sameuniversity inspired him with a love for metaphysicalspeculation, though failing to attract him to his own philosophy.Burnouf, at Paris in the following year, by teaching him Zend,started him on the track of enquiry into the science ofcomparative religion and impelled him to edit the RigVeda .When, in 1846, Max Muller came to England upon this errand,Baron Franz Bunsen, Prussian Minister in London, inconjunction with Prof. H. H. Wilson, prevailed upon the EastIndia Company to undertake the expense of its publication.Swami Vivekananda told his pupil, Sarat Chandra Chakravarti,about this great venture as follows. \u201cDidn\u2019t you hear that theEast India Company paid nine lakhs of rupees in cash to havethe RigVeda published? Even this money was not enough.Hundreds of Vedic Pundits had to be employed in this countryon monthly stipends. Has anybody seen in this age here in thiscountry such profound yearning for knowledge, such prodigiousinvestment of money for the sake of light and learning? MaxMuller himself has written it in his preface that for twenty-fiveyears he prepared only the manuscripts. Then the printing tooktwenty years.\u201d 81MAX MULLER ON  SRI RAMAKRISHNASWAMI VIVEKANANDA1100Max Muller settled down at Oxford in 1848, as theOxford University had taken up the printing of his RigVeda attheir press. He was appointed deputy Taylorian professor ofmodern languages in 1850 and a fellow of all souls. Hepublished during this period the essays that were subsequentlycollected as Chips  from a German Workshop and his Historyof Ancient Sanskrit Literature . He had the greatestdisappointment of his life when, in 1860, the chair of Sanskritfalling vacant, he failed to secure election on account of hisforeign birth and liberal connections, and the choice fell onMonier Williams. In 1868, however, he was indemnified forthis by the establishment of a chair of comparative philosophyto be filled by him. He ceased to lecture in 1875, when heentered upon the editorship of The Sacred Books of the East ,about which we have spoken above. In 1861 and 1863 hedelivered two courses of lectures at the Royal Institution, whichwere published as Science of Language . Comparative philologydid not originate with him \u2014 there being pioneers as early as1831, when Prichard by following its methods had proved theAryan affinities of the Celtic languages \u2014 but he certainlybrought it into vogue. Max Muller\u2019s studies in mythology ledhim to the comparative science of religion. His Introduction tothe Science of Religion marked an epoch. It was followed bythe four volumes of Gifford lectures, delivered between 1888and 1892; but the most tangible result of the impetus that hehad given was the publication, under his editorship, from 1875onwards, of The Sacred Books of the East . Max Muller died atOxford on 28 October 1900.Max Muller\u2019s extensive studies in Sanskrit literature hadled him to follow, as says Romain Rolland, \u201cwith ever freshcuriosity all the palpitations of the Hindu religious soul\u201d. Itwas during this quest that he had \u201cperceived, like the Magi ofold, in the East the rising star of Ramakrishna.\u201d He was as1101eager to question a direct witness of the new incarnation aswas Swami Vivekananda to meet one who loved his Master.\u201cThe young Swami of India bowed before the old sage ofEurope,\u201d says Romain Rolland, \u201cand hailed him as a spirit ofhis race, the reincarnation of an ancient Rishi, recalling hisfirst births  in the ancient days of Vedic India \u2014 `a soul that isevery day realizing its oneness with Brahman.\u2019\u201d \u201cProf. MaxMuller is a perfect Vedantist,\u201d Swami Vivekananda told areporter of the Madras Times , February, 1897, \u201cand has donesplendid work in Vedantism. He believes in reincarnation.\u201d 82He wrote to Mary Hale on 26 June 1895, \u201cYou are enjoying bythis time, I hope, the articles by Prof. Max Muller on the`Immortality of the Soul\u2019 which I sent to Mother Church. Theold man has taken in Vedanta, bones and all, and has boldlycome out.\u201d 83 A few days later he wrote to her that Max Mullerthought that those we love in this life we must have loved inthe past. That was why, he added, it seemed to him that hemust have belonged to the Holy Family (the Hales) in somepast life. That was also obviously why he thought that MaxMuller must have belonged to India in some past life. Hebelieved, as he told Sarat Chandra Chakravarti, that he wasSayana reborn. In an article in the Udbodhana dated 6 June1896 he said that when he asked the old man when he wouldvisit India, \u201cthe face of the aged sage brightened up \u2014 therewas almost a tear in his eye, a gentle nodding of the head, andslowly the words came out, \u2014 `I would not return then; youwould have to cremate me there.\u2019\u201d In the course of his reviewof Max Muller\u2019s book in the Udbodhana, Swamiji explainedthe point further. \u201cThat doctrine of reincarnation which is adread to the Christian who had identified the soul with thebody, he (Max Muller) firmly believes in, because of his havingfound conclusive proof in his own personal experience. Andwhat more, perhaps, his previous birth was in India; and lestTHE GREAT ORIENTALISTSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1102by coming to India, the old frame may break down under theviolent rush of a suddenly aroused mass of past recollections\u2014 is the fear in his mind that now stands foremost in the wayof his visit to this country.\u201d 84\u201cMax Muller is a Vedantist of Vedantists. He has. . .caught the real soul of the melody of the Vedanta,\u201d wroteSwamiji enthusiastically after he had first met him, in theBrahmavadin article dated 6 June 1896 referred to by us above.A few days earlier, on 30 May 1896, he had written in the samestrain to Mary Hale and Mrs. Bull. In his letter to the latter hehad added, \u201cAt the same time he is a friend of Yoga too, andbelieves in it. Only he has no patience with humbugs.\u201d 85Swamiji had a high opinion of Max Muller\u2019s \u201cLife and Sayingsof Ramakrishna\u201d, which sometimes, while lecturing in Americaduring his second visit to that country, he even quoted as anauthority in support of some of his own statements (see \u201cMyLife and Mission\u201d). 86 But he was aware that Max Muller, withall his love for India and devotion to Indian studies, wassometimes critical of the Hindu Religion, though this did notmake him waver in his attitude to him. In a letter, for instance,written to the Hale Sisters on 5 May (before he met theProfessor), he had observed as follows, \u201cI always thought that,although Prof. Max Muller in all his writings on the Hindureligion adds in the last a derogatory remark, he must see thewhole truth in the long run. As soon as you can, get a copy ofhis last book on Vedantism ; there you will find him swallowingthe whole of it.\u201d 87Swamiji had also little faith in the attempts made byWestern scholars, including Max Muller, to find out themeanings of Vedic words with the help of ComparativePhilology, and to ascertain the dates of the Vedic literature. Inhis lecture, \u201cThe Religion We Are Born In\u201d, delivered at Dacca1103on 31 March 1901, he said, \u201cI have no faith in the theoriesadvanced by Western scholars with regard to the Vedas at acertain period, and again tomorrow upsetting it and bringing itone thousand years forward, and so on.\u201d 88 Nor did he agreewith these scholars, (Max Muller being one of them), who gavegreat importance to the Samhita and the Brahmana portions ofthe Vedas, which (the socalled Karma Kanda) consisted ofsacrifices, etc., and had gone out of use. In his opinion it wasthe Jnana Kanda, which contained the Upanishads, or theVedanta, the end of the Vedas, the gist, and the goal of theVedas which constituted the Srutis par excellence . 89 SwamiVivekananda, however, had till the last the warmest personalregard for Max Muller, who fully reciprocated his sentimentsand never missed an opportunity for doing him a good turn(incidentally, he arranged for some lectures for him at Oxford).90 In his last days, Max Muller extended a warm hospitality toall visitors from India, where to this day he remains far betterknown than any other European Orientalist.Of far greater significance and consequence than hismeeting Max Muller was, however, Swami Vivekananda\u2019sdiscovery of Miss Margaret Noble, at this time known in certainhigh circles as a young intellectual, who had some originalideas about the education of the young. We have already spokenabout her first and subsequent attendances at Swamiji\u2019smeetings during his first visit to England. Before Swamiji hadleft for America, as we have seen above, she had addressedhim as Master, though what had impressed her deeply was asyet his personality and she had not accepted his teachings. AfterSwamiji\u2019s return to London, Miss Noble attended all hislectures, both at his residence and at public places. She drewthe attention of Swamiji to herself by her deep earnestness anddetermination to grasp the full meaning of all that he said, whichSWAMIJI ON MAX MULLERSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1104she expressed in constant queries to the lecturer, \u201cBut Swamiji!\u201d\u201cWhy Swamiji?\u201d At first only mildly surprised at her behaviour,Swamiji soon realized that that particular listener of his wasquite different from the others, and that that was because anirrepressible yearning for a higher life, and a strong urge fordedicating herself to some great ideal had possessed her youngheart. He clearly  saw that it was not for her, like others insociety, to walk the beaten track of life \u2014 with just a littlecuriosity about the ultimate truth in mind. He felt that she wasout to convert the ideal into the real and memories of his ownearly days with Sri Ramakrishna came back to his mind.Swamiji\u2019s words had raised a tempest in the youngwoman\u2019s mind. By now indeed she had lost her simple faith inmany of the tenets of her religion. But she still clung to certainideas which, she believed, must be followed by everybody whowanted to live a good life. These were now blown away \u2014many of them completely \u2014 and she had to pass through along and difficult process of reeducation. The path was strewnwith thorns but she was determined to traverse it, however herfeet bled and her heart broke. We shall give here something ofthe story as she has told us in The Master As I Saw Him . Oneat least felt that the good of others was an end in itself. It waswith surprise that she listened to \u201cthe decorous eastern teachingthat highest of all gifts was spirituality, a degree lower,intellectual knowledge, and that all kinds of physical andmaterial help came last.\u201d It took many years for Miss Noble tofind out that what Swamiji said was the truth.Similarly, to the Western fanaticism about pure air andhygienic surroundings, as if these were marks of saintliness,was opposed the stern teaching of indifference to the world.Here, indeed, she came up against a closed door and had nokey. The Swami at the same time said, in bold consciousness1105of paradox, that the saints had lived on mountain tops to enjoythe scenery, and he advised his hearers to keep flowers andincense in their worship rooms and to care much for the purityand cleansing of food and person. It took a long time for her tounderstand that Swamiji was but preaching the Western doctrineof refinement as it would be formulated in India. Truly, untilthe westerners succeeded in cleansing their slums, theirfastidiousness was very like the self-worship of the privileged.The same lesson was learnt when, having talked about thenecessity of making London fair, she received the startling reply,\u201cAnd yet you have blasted other cities \u2014 to make this city ofyours beautiful.\u201d A like fate awaited her admiration for suchsaints as knew how to order their worldly affairs withconspicuous success and prudence. Without faltering ormitigation, Swamiji gave his message \u2014 \u201cTrue spiritualitycannot tolerate the world.\u201dAccording to Swamiji, his greatest intellectualachievement at this time consisted in his lectures on Maya,and it is only by reading them, says Sister Nivedita, that anidea can be formed of the difficulty of the task he undertook,in trying to render this conception in English. He tried his bestto make his listeners comprehend the idea. \u201cThis is a statementof fact, not a theory,\u201d said the Swami, \u201cthat this world is aTantalus\u2019 hell, that we do not know anything about thisUniverse; yet at the same time we cannot say that we do notknow. To walk in the midst of a dream, half sleeping, halfwaking, passing all our lives in a haze, this is the fate of everyone of us. This is the fate of all sense knowledge. This is theUniverse.\u201d Maya, as Miss Noble understood the conception,was \u201cthat shimmering, elusive, half real, half unreal complexity,in which there is no rest, no satisfaction, no ultimate certainty,of which we have become aware through the senses, andthrough the mind as dependent on the senses.\u201dSWAMIJI ON MAX MULLERSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1106Swamiji did not reject the rationalistic religion of theWest. \u201cThe materialist is right! There is but One. Only he callsthat One Matter, and I call it God!\u201d said he. The individualsoul and the Absolute are one. \u201cThou art He, O man! Thou artHe!\u201d The God of Heaven is the God dwelling in the temple ofthe body. He, whom the Rishis have sought, is in the soul ofman. \u201cThou art He, O Man! Thou art He!\u201d Swamiji stood inthe midst of them all, says Sister Nivedita, as the apostle of theinner life, the prophet of the subordination of the objective tothe subjective. \u201cRemember!\u201d Swami Vivekananda told adisciple, \u201cRemember! the message of India is always, `Not thesoul for Nature but Nature for the soul!\u2019\u201d Gradually, thedifference of thinking in the East and the West on spiritual lifebecame quite clear in the mind of Miss Noble. In her owninimitable language it has been expressed as follows. The latteris \u201clike the sound of the flute, heard from far away on the banksof some river in the hour of dawn and regarded as one amongstmany sweet songs of the world.\u201d The former is \u201clike the samestrain when the listener has drawn nearer and nearer, and atlast, with his whole mind on the music, has become himselfthe player.\u201d And with that came the exaltation of renunciation.Swamiji did not talk of that life more often than he did before,but to Miss Noble the reality of that life, free, undimensioned,sovereign in its mastery, was now making itself directly felt.She fought against the temptation to go away, and bind uponherself intellectual shackles not to be borne, in order to be ableto enter in its fullness upon the life of poverty and silence.The call was uttered to her suddenly one day in one ofhis question and answer classes, after a dispute had occurredon something. The story is best told in her own words. \u201cWhatthe world wants today,\u201d said the Swami \u2014 the determinationto `throw a bomb\u2019, as he called it, evidently taking sudden1107possession of him, \u2014 \u201cWhat the world wants today, is twentymen and women who can dare to stand in the street yonder,and say that they possess nothing but God. Who will go?\u201d Then,rising to his feet, he stood looking round his audience as ifbegging some of them to join him. \u201c`Why should one fear?\u2019And then! in tones of which, even now, I can hear again thethunderous conviction, `If this is true, what else could matter?If it is not true, what do our lives matter ?\u2019\u201d Apparently, noneimmediately answered the call, but in Miss Noble\u2019s mind thewords echoed continuously day and night. On 7 June 1896,presumably shortly after this, she received a letter fromSwamiji. It was a call for sacrifice directly addressed to her forthe sake of the world. \u201cThe earth\u2019s bravest and the best willhave to sacrifice themselves for the good of many, for thewelfare of the world. Buddhas by the hundred are necessarywith eternal love and pity. . . . The world is in need for thosewhose life is one burning love, selfless. That love will makeevery word tell like thunderbolt. . . . Bold words and bolderdeeds are what we want. Awake, awake, great ones! The worldis burning with misery. Can you sleep? Let us call and call tillthe sleeping gods awake, till the god within answers to thecall. What more is in life? What greater work? The details cometo me as I go. I never make plans. Plans grow and workthemselves. I only say, `awake, awake.\u2019 May all blessing attendyou forever. \u2014 Yours affectionately, Vivekananda.\u201d 91Excessive work was telling upon Swamiji\u2019s health, andin the middle of July his friends took him out for a quiet stay inSwitzerland and a tour on the continent. Meanwhile, a devotedcircle of those who not only listened to but deeply poured onSwamiji\u2019s teachings and were finding out ways and means tomake them effective in the world, was growing up in England.They included Mr. E. T. Sturdy, Captain and Mrs. Sevier,SWAMIJI AND MISS NOBLESWAMI VIVEKANANDA1108Miss Muller, and Miss Noble. Already some plans had beenprepared. Miss Muller had decided to go to India and spendthe rest of her days and her vast wealth there. Captain andMrs. Sevier had made their plans for a Himalayan asrama sothat Swamiji\u2019s lifelong dream for one such could be givenreality. When Swamiji returned to England in the middle ofOctober,  he was already thinking deeply over the line of actionthat had to be followed in India, to which he had decided toreturn soon. To actualize Vedanta in Indian life \u2014 that, in brief,was the task to be accomplished. His gurubhais had agreed tocooperate in its fulfillment, but their work would necessarilybe mostly confined to men. Who was to work among thewomen? Margaret had decided to sacrifice herself for the work.To tell the story again in her own words, \u201cI learnt no more ofthe Indian point of view during my life in England. The friendwho afterwards called me to her side in India (Miss Muller)chose a certain evening in London, when both the Swami andmyself were her guests for an hour, to tell him of my willingnessto help his work. He was evidently surprised, but said quietly,`For my own part I will be incarnated two hundred times, ifthat is necessary to do this work amongst my people, that Ihave undertaken.\u2019 And the words stand in my own mind besidesthose which he afterwards wrote to me on the eve of mydeparture, ` I will stand by you unto death , whether you workfor India or not, whether you give up Vedanta or remain in it.The tusks of the elephant come out, but they never go back.Even so are the words of a man.\u201d 92VOn 24 June 1896, Swamiji wrote to Swami Ramakrishnananda,\u201cSharat starts for America tomorrow. The work here is comingto a head. We have already got funds to start a London centre.1109Next month I go to Switzerland to pass a month or two there,then I shall return to London. What will be the good of mygoing home? . . . For the present, I shall have Kali here, tellhim to be ready.\u201d 93 He was at the moment absorbed in hisLondon work but, as it appears from this letter, his friends wereviewing with alarm how his health was fast deteriorating, andat their insistence he had agreed to go out on a month or a twomonths\u2019  holiday in Switzerland. Then too it was the holidayseason for London and many of his students and admirers wereleaving the metropolis for seaside or mountain resorts. Thesuggestion of a holiday in Switzerland was readily acceptableto him \u2014 it held out the prospect of life in the midst of naturein all her solemn grandeur and loveliness. \u201cOh! I long to seethe snows and wander in the mountain paths,\u201d he exclaimed.(Switzerland has a grand attraction for tourists, \u2014 in the winterfor winter sports, in the summer for mountain climbing. TheAlps, the most imposing mountain system in Europe, constitute61% of Switzerland, with no fewer than 71 peaks having analtitude from 10,000 to 15,000 feet.) His heart jumped withjoy to think of climbing Mt. Blanc, the tallest of its peaks(15,771 feet), situated about forty miles from Geneva, whichwas to be their first halt, and which could be reached by anight\u2019s journey from Paris. Swamiji longed also to crossglaciers, of which Switzerland had more than 1000, and one ofthe largest, the Merde Glace was easily accessible from Geneva.There was also the prospect of seeing waterfalls, which werecountless in Switzerland, the most majestic among them beingthe falls of the Rhine at Schaffhausen, 100 feet high, inclusiveof rapids, and 340 feet wide. The Parivrajaka was up withinhim and he hoped once again to roam in the hills and do hardsadhanas in surroundings that were to remind him of theHimalayas and the life he had lived there \u2014 regrettably briefas it had been.SWAMIJI AND MISS NOBLESWAMI VIVEKANANDA1110With the best wishes of his students and admirers, manyof whom were absent but sent their messages throughMr. Sturdy, Swamiji left London on Sunday, 19 July 1896,accompanied by Miss Muller and Captain and Mrs. Sevier. TheEnglish Channel, usually choppy, chanced on this occasion tobe comparatively calm. In order to break the long journeybetween Calais and Geneva, they halted for the night at Parisand, resuming it on  the following day, arrived in excellentspirits at Geneva. The Hotel at which the party foundaccommodation overlooked the beautiful lake and for the nextthree days, to the delight of his friends, Swamiji gave himselfup to amusements like a child at play. On the very first day, hewent to a place where an Exhibition was being held and wasparticularly interested in the local arts including the celebratedwoodcarvings. After sunset, they went up a captive balloon,which sailed steadily and smoothly in the rarefied atmosphereand from which they could see the great city spread out like amap, while moving objects were almost indiscernible. We maybe sure he was reciting to himself Kalidasa\u2019s famous descriptionof the journey of Rama and Sita in the aerial chariot, Pushpaka, on their homeward journey to Ayodhya after the successfulwar with Ravana and his hosts. The verses, beginning withduradayaschakranibhasya tanvi, tamalatalivanarajinila , musthave been recalled to his mind. While at Geneva, Swamiji hadthe pleasure of bathing at one or more of the resorts for whichGeneva is famous and also paid a visit to the Castle of Chillon,with its poetic association of Lord Byron\u2019s famous poem, \u201cThePrisoner of Chillon\u201d.While his diversions at Geneva brought out the boy inhim, the roving monk was to come out as the party moved tothe village of Chamounix, some forty miles off Geneva. Asthey approached the village, the grand spectacle of Mont Blanc1111opened up to view, presenting a vision that he said he had notenjoyed even in the Himalayas. Here, he explained, one wasactually in the midst of the snows, which were very distant inIndia. He was anxious to climb Mont Blanc but was dissuadedfrom making the attempt since the guides told the party thatthis could be done only by skilled mountaineers. He, however,insisted on crossing the celebrated MerdeGlace glacier, but hefound the experience not quite so pleasing as he had expected,as he found it difficult to keep his footing. After the glacierwas crossed, a very steep ascent had to be climbed to reach thevillage above, and as he was doing it, he suffered from vertigo.From Chamounix, the party made an outing to the village ofLittle Saint Bernard, where he saw a litter of puppies,descendants of the famous dogs who used at one time to betrained by the monks of the Hospice (rest house) of St. Bernardon Mont Blanc to rescue climbers on the mountain side andwonderfully did so. Swamiji was anxious to have one of thepuppies so that he might take it with him to India. \u201cFortunatelyfor the dogs, they had been already sold \u2014 as they often areeven before their birth \u2014 for they would certainly have perishedlong before they could have reached their destination.\u201d94The party next wandered out to a village some milesaway where they stayed for two weeks and Swamiji felt himselfat peace and rest as he had been seldom in life. The mountainsand the snow had a quietening influence on him, as he wrote toMrs. Bull on 25 July 1896, and he had better sleep than he hadfor a long time. About this time also he wrote to Mr. Sturdy, \u201cIam reading a little, starving a good deal, and practising a gooddeal more. The strolls in the woods are simply delicious. Weare now situated under three glaciers, and the scenery is verybeautiful.\u201d 95 One day, however, as he was walking with hisfriends, attempting to climb up a hillside to its top, recitingA CONTINENTAL TOUR - SWITZERLAND, GERMANYSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1112and translating passages from the Upanishads \u2014 presumablycreating a Himalayan atmosphere for them, \u2014 it was only by amiracle that he was saved from an awful fate. They had gone alittle ahead and he was dropping behind, being lost in reverentcontemplation, when they saw him approaching rapidly andcalling out to them. When they were together, he told themthat he nearly fell over a precipice and that it was a miraclethat he was saved. As he was walking along, he explained, heplanted his alpenstock (long, iron shod staff used in climbingAlps, etc.) firmly on the ground, when it sank through the deepcrevice, and he almost fell over the precipice. His friends weregreatly agitated to hear this, thanked God for saving his lifeand resolved never again to leave him alone. At a little mountainchapel on their way homewards, Swamiji gathered some sweet-smelling flowers and asked Mrs. Sevier to offer them on hisbehalf at the feet of the Virgin. \u201cFor She also is the Mother,\u201dsaid he. He did not do it himself, because he was not a Christianand objections might be taken.It was during this Alpine holiday that the idea of aHimalayan asrama that the Swami had often longed for andtalked about to his friends, came back to his mind and he toldCaptain and Mrs. Sevier about it. As we learn from his letter tothe Hale Sisters dated 7 July 1896, there had been somediscussion on the subject already before they had started ontheir tour. At that time his planned monastery, in which hisEnglish friends were to live with him, was, as he said, \u201cin theair\u201d and \u201cstruggling to materialize somewhere in theHimalayas.\u201d 96 Now there came a definite commitment fromCaptain Sevier who said, \u201cWe must have such a monastery.\u201d 97Swamiji was greatly heartened at this development and he lostno time, while they were yet at the Alpine village, to write tohis friend, Lala Badri Shah, 5 August 1896, informing him1113about his decision to have a Math at Almora or nearby andrequesting him to be on the lookout for lands, preferably anentire hill where it could be constructed. 98 After Swamiji hadreturned to London, it seems, there were further discussions,and we find him again writing to Lalaji, on the eve of his startingback for home, 21 November 1896, to say that he was reachingMadras on 7 January 1897 and that two of his English friends,Captain and Mrs. Sevier, who were accompanying him wantedto settle at Almora. He reminded  him about the lands andrequested that in the meanwhile a bungalow might be rentedfor their residence. 99He could not free himself from thoughts of worldly affairseven at this Alpine retreat, much as he wished he should havenothing but rest and peace there, for the mails continued to beredirected from London and he found there was much that calledfor his immediate attention. Alasinga wrote to him about thefinancial difficulties which the management of theBrahmavadin was facing, and he had to send him, besidesassurance of help, stringent instructions about keeping properaccounts, etc. On 6 August 1896 he wrote to him \u201cTheBrahmavadin is a jewel \u2014 it must not perish.\u201d 100 He promisedto free him soon of his \u201cnonsense teacher business\u201d by helpinghim with Rs.100/ a month, so that he could give his undividedattention to the paper. \u201cWork on! Hold on! Be brave! Dareanything and everything,\u201d he exhorted. 101 And then, in his roleas guru, he gave him the advice, \u201cPay special attention tobrahmacharya (celibacy). You have a good number of children.Enough!\u201d 102 Letters also came to him from America, from someof which he came to know that Swami Kripananda had againleft him. He wrote a loving letter to him, enclosing a few hardyflowers growing in the midst of eternal snow, expecting, as hesaid, that he would attain to a similar spiritual hardihood. HeA CONTINENTAL TOUR - SWITZERLAND, GERMANYSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1114received a disquieting letter from Calcutta informing him that,because prostitutes attended the Ramakrishna birth anniversaryat Dakshineswar, many decent people were disinclined to gothere on the occasion. On 23 August he wrote to SwamiRamakrishnananda, \u201cIf public women are not allowed to go tosuch a great place of pilgrimage as Dakshineswar, where elseshall they go?\u201d He, however, advised \u201csome social vigilance.\u201dA few warders should make circuits and expel anybodybehaving improperly. \u201cBut so long as they behave like goodmen and women, they are Bhaktas and are to be respected \u2014be they men or women, honest citizens or unchaste.\u201d 103The fact that the peace and rest which he was enjoyingin his \u201cHimalayan\u201d environments at quiet retreats during thistour was often disturbed by business affairs like the above couldnot be considered as wholly without significance. We have seenthat on occasions when he was left too much to himself withcontemplation and meditation, his mind tended to lose itself inthe Infinite and sometimes in nirvikalpa samadhi. A \u201ctouch ofearth\u201d was needed on occasions like these to bring him back toa remembrance of his mission in life. As we learn from a letterhe wrote on 23 August 1896 to Mrs. Bull, he expressedsentiments which his friends respected, but which neverthelessthey did not like should get the uppermost in his mind, for theyknew he had much work to do yet. He wrote to Mrs. Bull, \u201cIthink I have worked enough. . . . I am now going to retire. . . Ihave begun the work, let others work it out. . . I am gettingready to depart to return no more to this hell, this world. . .May Mother gather me soon to Herself never to come backany more. These works and doing good, etc., are just like alittle exercise to cleanse the mind. I had enough of it. . . Whoworks? Whose work? There is no world. It is God Himself.\u201d1041115It almost seems it was some divine plan which pulledhim out at this time from his nest of peace and rest at his Alpineretreat and drew him to Germany, the land of work if also ofcontemplation and which at this time was the very vortex ofturbulent national life. A letter was received \u2014 redirected fromLondon \u2014 written to him by Prof. Paul Deussen of KielUniversity, requesting him to pay a visit to the city and staythere as his guest. The Professor was an ardent, even stern anduncompromising, Vedantist, had recently come back from atour of India, where he may probably have learned aboutSwamiji,  and had otherwise also done so by studying hislectures and utterances. He did not want to miss the opportunitythat Swamiji\u2019s stay in Europe afforded, of meeting him andhaving philosophical discussions with him. It seems the letterreached Swamiji in the first week of August 1896 (about the5th or 6th), and for a moment Swamiji hesitated to respond tothe invitation, being in the mood we have described above,and also, as he told Mr. Sturdy in a letter dated 8 August,because it would throw a further heavy financial burden on hisfriends. 105 But Miss Muller brushed aside his objections andat once telegraphed to Prof. Deussen who promptly replied, 9August, welcoming Swamiji. It was decided that he would beat Kiel at Deussen\u2019s on 10 September 1896. 106 The date of hismeeting Prof. Deussen was later changed by Miss Muller to19 September. 107 His friends insisted that he should completehis Swiss tour and also see something of Germany before hewent to Kiel. 108Some changes in the tour plan were needed becauseMiss Muller found that for urgent business she must return toEngland soon and it was decided that they should all go first toLucerne where she would take leave of them. To accommodateher, others in the party postponed their plan to visit Zermatt,A CONTINENTAL TOUR - SWITZERLAND, GERMANYSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1116which was not far from where they were staying, and whencethey could climb the Komergrat and have a view of snow-cladMatterhorn. However, proceeding first to Lucerne, they spenta few days there in sightseeing, Swamiji at least enjoyinghimself immensely, boy like, in such delights as ascending theRigi by the mountain railway, visiting the museum, etc. Biddinggoodbye to Miss Muller, the party again came back to the south,one of the beauty spots of Switzerland. 109 As to the idea ofclimbing the Matterhorn (14,692 feet), it was only Capt. Sevierwho could carry it out, the other two finding the air too rarefiedfor them to do so. However, by now Swamiji had had enoughof  mountaineering and, anxious to reach Kiel in time, they cutshort their Swiss programme by dropping the idea of visitingBerne, where Swamiji had planned to attend the PurityConference. On their way to Germany, they halted atSchaffhausen which was near the border and where, as we havesaid above, the Falls of the Rhine are seen at their best.In Germany, their first halt was at Heidelberg, the centreof one of the most famous German universities. Besides payinga visit to the university, they also saw the castle above the citywhere there is a cellar containing the largest cask in the world.Thence they went to Coblenz, where they spent a night andthence by steamer along the Rhine to Cologne, where they spentseveral days visiting worth-seeing places, including the far-famed cathedral. They saw not only the sanctuary but also thetreasury of the cathedral, which contained many gold plates,jewelled crosses and religious vestments. Swami Vivekanandaadmired the artistic excellence of the objects, that had beenwrought altogether by the hands of the nuns and noble ladies.They then left for Berlin, as he insisted on visiting the far-famed capital of the German empire, at the time believed to bethe greatest military power on earth and already launched on1117its career of imperialist expansion. Swamiji was struck withthe general prosperity of Germany and with the large numberof cities built after the modern style, of which he had glimpsesas the train pushed across them. According to The Life , 110 hethought that Berlin contrasted favourably with Paris itself. Inthe Memoirs of European Travel , however, he said, \u201cAfterParis there is no other city in the Western world; everywhere itis an imitation of Paris \u2014 or at least an attempt at it.\u201d 111Reaching Kiel, a city beautifully situated on the Baltic,they first put up at a hotel and informed Prof. Deussen abouttheir arrival. The latter immediately requested them to cometo his house on the following morning for lunch. They receiveda cordial reception from the Professor and his wife, who spokeEnglish fluently and had accompanied her husband on hisIndian tour. The conversation quickly turned to the system ofVedanta which, said the Professor, constituted \u201csome of themost majestic structures and valuable products of the geniusof man in his search for Truth\u201d and was at the same time \u201cthestrongest support of pure morality and the greatest consolationin the sufferings of life and death.\u201d He quoted from an addresshe had delivered before the Bombay branch of the Royal AsiaticSociety on 25 February 1895, which contained a valuable andmuch needed piece of advice to Indians, who were obliviousof the value of their own culture. \u201cAnd so the Vedanta in itsunfalsified form,\u201d the German sage had said, \u201cis the strongestsupport of pure morality, is the greatest consolation in thesuffering of life and death. Indians, keep to it!\u201d The Swamiand the Professor were soon engaged in a discussion on sometranslations the latter was making at the time, which led toexchanges of thought on broader topics. \u201cThe vigorous andlucid expositions given by the Oriental exegetist,\u201d saysMrs. Sevier, who wrote an excellent account of this visit, \u201cwithA CONTINENTAL TOUR - SWITZERLAND, GERMANYSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1118such firmness of conviction, and yet such delicacy ofperception, eventually quite won over the German savant.\u201d Anumber of times, Mrs. Sevier reminded them that it was timefor them to leave but the Professor insisted on their remainingto dinner and also joining in a festivity to be held, later on, inhonour of their daughter\u2019s fourth birthday. So, the conversationscontinued and the Professor narrated to his guests stories ofhis Indian travel, \u2014 about the holy Ganga in which thousandstake their daily baths, about temples and bazaars, and aboutbeggars who awaited one at every street corner and were a\u201cgenuine sign\u201d of \u201cthe terrible poverty\u201d of the people. It wason this day too that the Professor was amazed at the proof thathe had of Swamiji\u2019s colossal memory, the  story of which wehave narrated in Chapter 3. After tea, they went out to see theExhibition of German arts and industries which greatlyimpressed Swamiji. They saw also the harbour of Kiel and therecently constructed canal which by connecting Kiel with themouth of the Elbe offered to the merchant ships of all nationsthe safest, most convenient, shortest, and cheapest passagebetween the two seas (the Baltic and the North Seas). It hadalso doubled the effective fighting strength of the German navy,and the formal opening of the canal a few days ago with muchfanfare by the Kaiser had caused uneasiness in England.A great friendship grew up between the 52 year oldGerman savant (1845_1919) and the 33yearold Indian monkand, failing to induce the Swami to stay with him for a fewmore days, the Professor told him about his decision to joinhim at Hamburg and thence travel in his company to Englandwhere to enjoy a few more days of meetings with him. It is notto be supposed, however, that, as Mrs. Sevier seems to suggest,their discussions, friendly and prolonged as they were, led tothe conversion of the one to the views held by the other. Swamiji1119did not object to Deussen\u2019s interpretation of Vedanta eventhough it was of the most uncompromising kind. In a letter toMr. Sturdy from Kiel dated 10 September, he remarked \u2014without comments \u2014 as follows. \u201cHe is what I should call `awarring Advaitist\u2019. No compromise with anything else.`Ishwara\u2019 is his bugbear. He would have none of it if he could.\u201d112 Later, in a very appreciative article on the Professor in theUdbodhana (1896), he specially praised Deussen\u2019s freedomfrom inhibitions which had prevented earlier WesternSanskritists from correctly estimating Indian thought. SaidSwamiji, \u201cDeussen, unhampered by any philological leaningsand possessing the training of a philosopher well versed in thespeculations of ancient Greece and modern Germany took upthe cue and plunged boldly into the metaphysical depths  ofthe Upanishads, found them to be fully safe and satisfying, andthen \u2014 equally boldly \u2014 declared the fact before the world.\u201d113The fact, however, is that Deussen and Swamiji differedfrom each other on certain essential ideas of philosophicthinking. In his reminiscences of Swamiji, contributed to theVedanta Kesari of February 1937, Mr. E. T. Sturdy has thrownconsiderable light on this subject. \u201cI remember well,\u201d wroteMr. Sturdy, \u201chis discussion with Dr. Paul Deussen, the thenhead of Kiel University. He pointed out where Schopenhauerand Von Hartmab were wrong in founding their philosophyupon the blind will, the Unconscious, as contrasted withUniversal Thought.\u201d 114 It may be noted that on the questionsconcerning the will, including that of freedom, Deussen was adisciple of Schopenhauer. In a letter to Mr. Sturdy sometimeafter his return to New York from London (about December,1895), Swamiji had elucidated the point of his difference withSchopenhauer rather elaborately. We quote the relevant portion,though it is rather long. \u201cSchopenhauer caught this idea ofAT KIEL WITH DEUSSENSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1120willing from the Buddhists. . . . We have it also in Vasana , orTrishna , Pali Tanha . We also admit that it is the cause of allmanifestations which are, in their turn its effects. But, being acause, it must be a combination of the Absolute and Maya .Even knowledge, being a compound, cannot be the Absoluteitself, but it is the nearest approach to it and higher than Vasana, conscious or unconscious. The Absolute first becomes themixture of knowledge, then, in the second degree, that of will.If it be said that plants have no wills, the answer is that eventhe unconscious plant will is a manifestation of theconsciousness, not of the plant, but of the cosmos, the Mahatof the Sankhya Philosophy.\u201cThe Buddhist analysis of everything into will isimperfect, firstly, because will itself is a compound, andsecondly, because consciousness or knowledge which is acompound of the first  degree, precedes it. Knowledge is action.First action , then reaction . When the mind perceives, then, asthe reaction, it wills . So it is absurd to say that will is the lastanalysis. Deussen is playing into the hands of the Darwinists.But evolution must be brought in accordance with the moreexact science of Physics, which can demonstrate that everyevolution must be preceded by an involution. This being so,the evolution of the Vasana or will, must be preceded by theinvolution of the Mahat or cosmic consciousness.\u201cThere is no willing without knowing. How can we desireunless we know the object of desire? \u201cThe apparent difficulty vanishes as soon as you divideknowledge also into subconscious and conscious. And why not?If will can be so treated, why not its father?\u201d 1151121Romain Rolland says that Deussen, who saw SwamiVivekananda in a happy and relaxed mood, was unable tounderstand the tragic seriousness that lay at the bottom of hisheart, obsessed as it was by his miserable people, and that, ashis notes in his Journal show, he could not foresee the greatdestiny of his young visitor. 116 Even if he did understandSwamiji, one might say that it was discreet of a German, whohad seen with his own eyes during a recent visit to India thestate of appalling poverty that she had been reduced to underBritish rule, not to exchange his feelings on the subject with ayoung Indian whose love for his fellow countrymen was alltoo manifest  to escape his notice. The fact is that the strugglewith Britain was about to begin, and the Germans had alreadybegun to take an interest in the Indian national movement(specially its revolutionary wing) in the hope of finding an allyin their coming fight against the British empire. A dedicatedscholar and philosopher like Deussen whose predominantinterest in matters Indian lay in her ancient philosophy musthave been anxious to keep himself above the suspicion that hehad any sympathy for India\u2019s political aspirations. If heunderstood Swamiji\u2019s patriotism, and it would be really strangeif he failed to do so, he would certainly not attempt to probe it,accompanied as he moreover was by an ex-officer of the Britisharmy and his wife. Max Muller could freely express beforeSwamiji his great love for India and reverence forSubconsciousConsciousConsciousness or Mahat  SuperconsciousUnconscious Will Conscious WillSuperconscious WillProperAT KIEL WITH DEUSSENSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1122Sri Ramakrishna, being a naturalized English citizen and highin government and court circles. Deussen, who needed the goodgraces of Anglo-Indian officials in India and the sympathies offellow orientalists of England, had to be very careful in hisdealings with a young Indian who perhaps even then was notin the good books of the rulers of his country. He did not talkwith him even on Sri Ramakrishna about whom surely he knewand whom he must have respected. It appears to us thatDeussen\u2019s reticence on the subject of Swamiji in his talks withhis guests and in his record of them in his Journal do not giveus the whole story of their meetings with each other.However, after three weeks had passed in holiday touring,Swamiji felt that he must now return to London and he toldMrs. Sevier that she must make plans for their immediatejourney back to England. Dr. Deussen, who wanted that heshould have more of Swamiji and discuss some philosophicalsubjects with him in greater details, objected. But when Swamijitold him that he wanted to return to India soon and that beforehe could  do so must better organize his London work, hewaived his objection and proposed, as we have said above, tojoin him at Hamburg and thence to go to England in hiscompany. So Swamiji and party now left Kiel and proceededto Hamburg, their next halting place, where they saw the famousZoological Gardens. When they had been there for three days,Prof. Deussen arrived, Mrs. Deussen, who was very eager tocome and meet Swamiji again, being unable to do so. Theythen journeyed to Amsterdam, and remained there for threedays, during which time they visited the art galleries, themuseums and other places of interest. Swamiji was speciallydelighted with the strange appearance of the cities of Hollandwith their canals for their streets. The voyage to England wasunpleasant but fortunately it was short and when he reached1123the British shores his friends were glad to notice a considerableimprovement in his health.VIWhen Swami Vivekananda returned to England on 17September 1896, some good news was awaiting him. When hewas at Lucerne, he had received information that SwamiAbhedananda had already started for England by the B.I.S.N.steamship Mombasa on 11 August 1896 and that he was dueto reach London on or about 15 September ( vide his letter toMr. Sturdy from Lucerne dated 23 August 1896). 117 The factthat his gurubhais at Alambazar had not made the kind of delayin sending Swami Abhedananda as they had done in the caseof sending Swami Saradananda, as also the news of his safearrival, highly pleased Swamiji. Then again Harriet Hale\u2019s letterinforming him about her coming marriage, which was awaitinghim, highly pleased him. He wrote immediately to her, sendingher and her fianc\u00e9 his blessings and his best wishes, quotingfrom Kalidasa\u2019s Abhijnana Sakuntala the words used by thesage Kanva on the eve of Sakuntala\u2019s departure for herhusband\u2019s place. The letter ended with the  benediction, \u201cMayyou be like Uma, chaste and pure throughout your life \u2014 mayyour husband be like Shiva, whose life was in Uma.\u201d118 Hishappiness was not unmingled with some sadness at the thoughtthat Mary as also his other \u201csisters\u201d continued to be maids andon the same day he wrote to Mary a long letter \u2014 one of thefinest he ever wrote to her \u2014 giving her his thoughts on thesubject of their marriage prospects. 119The thought of his highly strung \u201csister\u201d and of the rightway by which she could find happiness in life continued to bein his mind and on 1 November he wrote again to her a longBACK TO ENGLANDSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1124letter, which is truly a masterpiece. The letter began with thewords, \u201c`Gold and silver\u2019, my dear Mary, ` have I none, butwhat I have I give to thee freely\u2019 and that is the knowledge thatthe goldness of gold, the silverness of silver, the manhood ofman, the womanhood of woman, the reality of everything isthe Lord.\u201d It is in this letter of his that, after referring to theprevailing controversy about the currency standard (gold versussilver), he stated, \u201cI am a socialist not because I think it isa perfect system, but half a loaf is better than no bread. . . .A redistribution of pain and pleasure is better than always thesame persons having pains and pleasures. The yoke will belifted from shoulder to shoulder by new systems, that\u2019s all. Letevery dog have his day in this miserable world, so that after allthis experience of socalled happiness they may all come to theLord.\u201d He traced the evolution of human society throughperiods of government successively by the four castes \u2014 thepriests, the soldiers, the traders, and the labourers \u2014 eachhaving \u201cits glories as well as its defects.\u201d He predicted thecoming rule of the labourers (Sudras) which will have as itsadvantage the distribution of physical comforts and itsdisadvantages of (perhaps) the lowering of culture. An objectivemillennium, he observed, existed only in fancy, but a subjectiveone was already in existence. \u201cThe musk deer after vain searchfor the cause of the scent of the musk, at last will have to findit in himself.\u201d Mankind will have to leave behind its cherishedvanity of a world and governments and through love come tothe Lord. 120 The moral was quite obvious for Mary to ponderover. In yet another letter, which he addressed to Mary andHarriet Hale and could find time to write while still in London,he reminded the four \u201csisters\u201d about his love for them, and hisbelief that it was reciprocated.  1211125After staying for a few days with Captain and Mrs. Sevierin Hampstead, Swamiji commenced his work by giving twodrawing room lectures within the first two weeks at AirlieLodge, Ridgeway Gardens, Wimbledon, the residence ofMiss Muller. The London work could not, however, go onwithout his living in London and so, somewhat to the chagrinof the old lady, he changed his quarters to 14 GreycourtGardens, Westminster, London, where the Seviers had taken aflat for him and Swami Abhedananda. Close by, at 39 VictoriaStreet, Mr. Sturdy had engaged a large room with ampleaccommodation, with a view to giving the London public achance for hearing Swamiji\u2019s lectures. As those who hadattended his classes before pressed him to reopen them, thiswas done on 8 October 1896 and weekly public lectures werealso resumed. For two whole weeks, during his stay in London,Professor Deussen was with the Swami day and night. At thesame time Prof. Max Muller was in communication withSwamiji. \u201cThus three great minds were conversing with eachother.\u201d All this time, and for that matter during the rest of hisdays in London, Swamiji was constantly writing to his Indianand American disciples, encouraging them in the activitieswhich each was engaged in and informing them about theprogress and success of his own work in England. He speciallypraised Miss Waldo, observing that he would be  thousand timesmore pleased to see one of his American disciples carrying onthe work successfully than any number of Hindus doing so,even one of his brethren. He wrote a number of letters toAlasinga, speaking about the increasing success of his laboursin England and warmly praising Englishmen for steadiness andloyalty. In one of these letters, he referred to the work that hehad started in America and observed, \u201cHalf the United Statescan be conquered in ten years, given a number of strong andgenuine men.\u201d \u201cMy child,\u201d continued he, \u201cwhat I want isBACK TO ENGLANDSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1126London, 18961127London, December, 1896SWAMI VIVEKANANDA1128London, December, 18961129London, December, 1896SWAMI VIVEKANANDA1130muscles of iron and nerves of steel, inside which dwells a mindof the same material as that of which the thunderbolt is made.Strength, manhood, Kshatra Virya + BrahmaTeja.\u201d He said thatIndia had \u201cbeautiful, hopeful boys,\u201d who had everything butwere being slaughtered at the altar of \u201cthis brutality they callmarriage.\u201d He wanted at least a hundred Madrasi young mento \u201cstand aside from the world, gird their loins, and be ready tofight the battle of truth, marching on from country to country.\u201d122The first of the two lectures that Swamiji had deliveredin Miss Muller\u2019s drawing room, while staying with her atWimbledon, was well attended, the majority of the listenersbeing fashionable young women. The subject was \u201cVedanta asa Factor in Civilization\u201d, and at the end of the lecture theChairman cordially thanked the speaker for the intellectualpleasure he had afforded the audience. Classes were arrangedimmediately, in which Swamiji gave both private and generalinstruction, teaching many of the principles of Raja Yoga andthe practice of meditation. His public lectures were mostly onJnana Yoga, those that attracted the greatest attention being onthe Hindu theory of Maya. As Sister Nivedita tells us, he himselfconsidered these lectures as being his greatest intellectualachievement. How successfully he rendered the idea of Maya,which has puzzled even the ancient philosophers of his ownland, into a modern language will be apprehended by everyone,says The Life , who carefully studies his lectures on \u201cMaya andIllusion\u201d, \u201cMaya and Freedom\u201d, and \u201cThe Absolute and theManifestation\u201d. The other lectures that he delivered during thisperiod which followed were on \u2014 \u201cGod in Everything\u201d,\u201cRealization\u201d, \u201cUnity in Diversity\u201d, \u201cThe Freedom of the Soul\u201d,as also the last series of four lectures known as \u201cThe PracticalVedanta\u201d. In these lectures Swamiji is found full of that oneluminous thought of Advaita, that there is but One Infinite1131Existence \u2014 the Sat Chit Anandam. That, according to thisteaching, is the innermost soul of man; and the soul of man isas such, in essence, eternally free and divine, all manifestationsbeing but the varying expressions of this nature of the Soul.These lectures were delivered in deep earnestness, not onlybecause Swamiji thought that by the great advance that theWest had made in science and Rajasic activities it had reachedan intellectual stage in which it could more easily imbibe thethought of Advaita but because he was convinced that it mustaccept it if it wanted an escape from a catastrophe, which wasforeshadowed by fierce international hatreds and the piling upof weapons of destruction.The Western world has already gone through twodevastating World Wars, and a third one, in which nuclearweapons will surely be used and may even annihilate it, if nothumanity, is not considered as beyond the range of possibility.The fact and the possibility highlight the life sustaining teachingof Vedanta which Swamiji, as he said, was determined to injectinto the very bones of Englishmen before he left their country.It is not possible to evaluate his work, for obviously it couldnot accomplish tangible results within a short time, but no doubtwhatever exists that it had a powerful influence on the thoughtsof many minds in the country. As we read in The Life , 123 \u201cHisrevelation of the  glory and the majesty of the soul, his exaltationof renunciation, his exhortation for the life of burning, selflesslove, his reiteration of the Divine nature of man, his call for apractical test of the highest truths of the Vedanta, made himstand forth as the apostle of a new Spiritual Reformation. Theunspeakable power of his personality behind his utterancesmade every word tell like a thunderbolt on his audience. Inone of his lectures on Maya he rose to such heights of feelingthat his whole audience was transported out of themselves soBACK TO ENGLANDSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1132much so that they lost all sense of personality, as it were, beingmerged in the consciousness of the Highest for the time being.\u201dIt would be unreasonable to expect that his teachings,which ran counter to the ingrained convictions of the massesin the materialistically minded West, could rouse no protestsin England. We learn from a letter he wrote to Alasingasometime during this visit to England 124 that while the leadingphysiologist in America was charmed with his speculations inthe Raja Yoga, there were some in England who ridiculed them.\u201cIn England, of course,\u201d said he, \u201cthey are gentlemen and nevertalk the rot I had in America.\u201d Already, during his first visit, aswe have seen, he had been pleasantly surprised at the cordialityof Englishmen he had met or known and formed a goodimpression, or even revised his previous notions of the characterof the English people. His experiences of his present visit filledhim with high hopes of achieving a good measure of successin carrying out his mission. On 3 July 1896 he wrote to hisfriend, Mr. Francis Leggett, \u201cWell, the work is growing silentlyyet surely in England. Almost every other man or woman cameto me and talked about the work. This British Empire with allits drawbacks is the greatest machine that ever existed for thedissemination of ideas. I mean to put my ideas in the centre ofthis machine, and they will spread all over the world. Of course,all great work is slow, and the difficulties are too many,especially as we Hindus are the conquered race. Yet, that is thevery reason why it is bound to work, for spiritual ideals havealways come from the downtrodden. Jews overwhelmed theRoman Empire with their spiritual ideals. You will be pleasedto know that I am also learning many lessons every day inpatience and, above all, in sympathy. I think I am beginning tosee the Divine inside the high and mighty Anglo-Indians. I1133think I am also slowly approaching to that state when I shouldbe able to love the very `Devil\u2019 himself, if there were any.\u201d 125As we have pointed out earlier, sentiments such as heexpressed in the abovementioned letter, and on some otheroccasions, such as at his last appearance in London at a meetingto bid him farewell, 15 December 1896, 126 should not induceus to think that Swamiji was falling in love with Britishimperialism, or the character of the Anglo-Indian as such. SisterNivedita and other disciples who were present at theabovementioned London meeting welcomed his view that PaxBritannica , like Pax Romana , would help spread a new gospelall over the world. The Sister found in Swamiji\u2019s words thewelcome assurance that \u201cthere would yet be seen a great armyof Indian preachers in the West, reaping the harvest he hadsown so well, and making ready in their turn new harvests forthe more distant reaping of the future.\u201d 127 Swamis Saradanandaand Abhedananda had been welcomed by Swamiji\u2019s Westerndisciples as being the precursors of the new movement, butthere were people in England and America who thoughtotherwise. As we shall see below, the reiteration of the idea ina letter of Swami Ramakrishnananda to Swamiji\u2019s Americanstudents, was regarded by many Americans as \u201can aggressivemove\u201d. The Indian Mirror of 3 July 1896 quoted an Americanpaper that gave this name to its readers. The paper had prefacedits statement with the words, \u201cSo successful  was SwamiSaradananda that another speaker will come. Eminent convertswill be made.\u201d Swamiji was well aware of the \u201ctoo manydifficulties\u201d that confronted him, and because of which, as weknow, \u201cthe London work from which the Swami had expectedso much collapsed.\u201d 128 He had also no illusions, it is worthmentioning again, about the real nature of British rule in India,BACK TO ENGLANDSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1134on which his views were later stated in a letter to Mary Haleon 30 October 1899.Nevertheless, Swami Vivekananda had good reasons forbeing satisfied with the success he achieved in England duringtwo short visits, and for expecting greater results in future. Hemet some eminent Englishmen, such as Canon Wilberforce,Edward Carpenter (the great author of \u201cTowards Democracy\u201d),and they showed a keen interest in Vedanta philosophy. Eminentclergymen, like Canon Haweis, attended his classes, and hehimself went to churches and listened to sermons, which borethe impress of Vedantic thoughts. He had come across Britisherslike Captain and Mrs. Sevier, Miss Muller, and, above all,Miss Noble, who had not only become his disciples but haddecided to follow him to India and dedicate themselves to hiscause. Besides lecturing in public halls and taking privateclasses, he had talked in private drawing rooms, in fashionableclubs and to select audiences in London and Oxford. He hadreceived considerable attention from the British press, and oneof the most influential and conservative among the newspapers,viz., The Standard , had compared him not only to hisforerunners, Raja Ram Mohan Roy and Keshub Chandra Senbut to Buddha and Christ. About his appearance in London,Mr. Eric Hammond wrote in the July, 1907 issue of theBrahmavadin as follows, \u201cA voice, sounded in farawayChicago, had, with notable eloquence, acclaimed the ancientphilosophy and religion embodied in Vedanta. The voice,pulsating with the might of its message,  aroused worldwideinterest. It issued from the lips of the most powerful, perhapsthe most purposeful, of representatives assembled in theCongress of Religions. Great Britian wanted to hear for herselfwhat America was privileged to hear. On his arrival in London,Swami Vivekananda, the owner and employer of that voice1135was welcomed in the quiet, thoughtful, self-calculating way towhich Londoners generally habituate themselves. Perhaps themissionary everywhere is met by an atmosphere not exactlyantagonistic but, at the least, doubtful. That Swamiji recognizedthis element of doubt and wonderment is certain and it is certain,too, that his winning personality cleared a way through it andfound glad welcome in many hearts.\u201dAt one of these meetings, as we learn from this article,Swami Vivekananda spoke about his Master and of his ownindebtedness to him. After telling something of the earth lifeof Sri Ramakrishna and dwelling on his message, he said thathe had not one little word of his own to utter, not oneinfinitesimal thought of his own to unfold. Everything, everysingle thing, all he was himself, all he might be to the world,he declared, came from that single source. \u201cIn passages ofexquisite eloquence,\u201d said Mr. Hammond, \u201che dilated uponSri Ramakrishna. Self was utterly forgotten, altogether ignored.`I am what I am, and what I am is always due to him. Whateverin me or in my words is good and true and eternal came to mefrom his mouth, his heart, his soul. Sri Ramakrishna is thespring of this phase of the earth\u2019s religious life, of its impulsesand activities. If I can show the world one glimpse of my MasterI shall not live in vain.\u2019\u201d In another article in the Brahmavadin, May, 1907, Mr. Hammond described an event that broughtinto highlight Swami Vivekananda\u2019s selflessness andforgetfulness about personal name and fame. The occasion washis appearance at a club in Bloomsbury Square with his\u201cdisciple\u201d, Swami Abhedananda,  and his purpose was tointroduce his gurubhai who was intended by him to carry onhis work in London after he had left, to the public. The Swamiappeared, says Mr. Hammond, \u201can embodiment of calm, ofsagacity, of assured attainment. His countenance lacked thatPROGRESS OF WORK  IN ENGLANDSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1136London, December, 18961137London, December, 1896SWAMI VIVEKANANDA1138expression of interrogation which is often inseparable fromthe faces of the clerics of the West. Certainty enwrapped himgarment wise. One had, in his presence, a sense that he knew,that he would speak as one having authority. His smile, inresponse to my salutation was that of a friend, a brother, acomrade in the way. . . . It had a kindly radiance, a love deepand steadfast, a something so subtly exquisite that no word butineffable can be found for it. . . .\u201dThe audience was somewhat disappointed to learn thatit was not he but Swami Abhedananda who would speak. Thesubject was the philosophy of the Panchadasi , a great workon Vedanta. Swami Abhedananda gave a brilliant expositionof the subject, and of Vedanta philosophy in general. SwamiVivekananda was delighted. Says Mr. Hammond, \u201cAnoverwhelming joy was noticeable in his scholar\u2019s success. Joycompelled him to put at least some of itself into words thatrang with delight unalloyed. It was the joy of a spiritual fatherover the achievement of a well-beloved son, a successful andbrilliant student. The Master was more than content to haveeffaced himself in order that his Brother\u2019s opportunity shouldbe altogether unhindered. The whole impression had in it aglowing beauty quite indescribable. It was as though the Masterthought and knew his thought to be true: Even if I perish out ofthis plane, my message will be sounded through these dearlips, and the world will hear it. As usual, some talk followed.Interested persons put questions, to which the Master repliedwith unfailing rapidity and lucidity, exhibiting an almostbewildering command of knowledge and resource. Heremarked  that this was the first appearance of his dear Brotherand pupil as an English-speaking lecturer before an Englishaudience, and he pulsated with pure pleasure at the applausethat followed that remark.\u201d We may mention in this connection1139that at this time Swami Saradananda who, as we have seen,had been sent by Swamiji to America on 25 June 1896, becausehe had taken too long a time to reach England and when hereached had little to do there, he (Swamiji) himself having cometo England, was reportedly doing well in America, seeSwamiji\u2019s letter to Swami Ramakrishnananda, 3 July 1896. 129After attending the Greenacre Conference, he had gone todeliver lectures at Boston, Brooklyn, and New York, and thensettled down at New York, making a good impressioneverywhere.In the midst of all his preoccupations, \u2014 interviews,public and private lectures, etc. \u2014 Swamiji, as he wrote toAlasinga about three weeks after returning from his continentaltour, 130 was \u201cbusy writing something big on the Vedantaphilosophy.\u201d This idea had remained in his mind for a longtime and never left him, but though he attempted to carry it outmany times he never succeeded in doing so. The desire to writenot only on philosophy, such as Vedanta, but on less serioussubjects possessed him from time to time, and occasionally hesuggested to his disciples some subjects on which they couldwrite, as for example to Dr. Nanjunda Rao in his letter to himdated 14 April 1896. 131 (He suggested that, in a magazine forboys which the latter was proposing to start, stories which werefound scattered all over the Sanskrit literature could be rewrittenin a popular style. They could evidently be published in bookform later.) He himself had an idea of writing a book for childrenlike Alice in Wonderland , he once told an American audiencein 1896. 132 After he had been in America for a few days only,he had thought of writing a book on that country, but he couldnot write a page even after he had stayed there three years, hesaid in course of a speech at Boston. His wonderful Parivrajaka, translated into English as Memoirs of European Travel , wasPROGRESS OF WORK  IN ENGLANDSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1140begun to be written, at the importunate request of SwamiTrigunatitananda who edited the Udbodhana , during his secondvoyage to the West and serially contributed to that paper. Thisbook which contains his acute reflections on the state of Europeat the time, besides observations on a bewildering variety ofsubjects concerning history, anthropology and what not, is muchmore than a book of travels. He could have given the world somuch even on secular subjects, if he had chosen to write, orrather had the leisure to do so, but unfortunately he had ratherdistaste for writing books, and his life was so brief.To come back to his project for a magnum opus onVedanta philosophy, he wrote to Alasinga in the letter referredto above as follows, \u201cI am busy collecting passages from thevarious Vedas bearing on the Vedanta in its threefold aspect.You can help me by getting somehow to collect passagesbearing on, first the Advaitic ideas, then the Visishtadvaitic,and the Dvaitic from the Samhitas, the Brahmanas, theUpanishads, and the Puranas. They should be classified andvery legibly written with the name and chapter of the book, ineach case. It would be a pity to leave the West, without leavingsomething of the philosophy in book form.\u201d He told him thathe had seen a compilation of the one hundred and eightUpanishads in Tamil characters in the library of Prof. Deussenat Kiel, and requested that if there was a reprint of the work inDevanagari, it should be sent to him. If the latter was notavailable, he asked Alasinga to send him the Tamil edition,and also write on a sheet the Tamil letters and compounds, alljuxtaposed with their Nagari equivalents so that he could learnthe Tamil letters also. We do not know if Alasinga did send thebook to him as he had instructed  (with Devanagari equivalents,etc.), for a Devanagari reprint was most probably not available.If he did, it does not seem probable that it reached him in time1141for him to utilize it before he left for home, and in any case theidea of writing on the Vedanta did not materialize. However, itnever left him, and even as late as January, 1901 when he cameto Mayavati, he told his disciples that he was seriously thinkingof retiring from the life of public preaching and devoting therest of his days to writing books. Later, after returning to themonastery at Belur he began two works which he styled \u201cIndia\u2019sMessage to the World\u2019\u2019 and \u201cThe Messages of Divine Wisdom\u201d,and prepared a Syllabus for each of them. Another Syllabusfor an intended work, evidently on the history and the gradualgrowth of civilization in India, was also found among hispapers.133In the letter to Alasinga referred to above, Swamiji hadsaid, \u201cThe work in London is growing apace, the classes arebigger as they go on. I have no doubt this will go on increasingat this rate and the English people are steady and loyal. Ofcourse, as soon as I leave, most of this fabric will tumble down.\u201dWith sure knowledge that his continued stay in England wasabsolutely necessary for progress of the work in that country,Swamiji nevertheless decided suddenly one day that he mustreturn to India. His friends were rather taken aback, forevidently the impression they had was that he would stay inEurope for a few months longer. He had planned to visit Russiain April, 1897, as we learn from his letter to Miss JosephineMacLeod dated 3 December 1896, 134 and just then things werein a \u201chum\u201d in London. But, as he told her, \u201cthe good old countrynow calls me; I must go,\u201d \u201cOf course everybody here thinks itfoolish to give it up just now the `boom\u2019 is on, but the dearLord says, `Start for Old India.\u2019 I obey.\u201d The command fromOn High, for which he always waited before taking any majorstep in life,  had evidently been received, and so one eveningafter the end of one of the classes towards the middle ofPROGRESS OF WORK  IN ENGLANDSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1142November, he called Mrs. Sevier aside and asked her quietlyto purchase four tickets immediately for the most convenientsteamer from Naples. The plan was to shorten the sea voyageby travelling to Naples via the Continent, thereby also enablinghim to visit some of the important cities of Italy en route .Mrs. Sevier was surprised, accustomed as she was to his suddenchanges and outbursts of spontaneity, but she complied. Fourberths (for the Swami, Mr. and Mrs. Sevier, and Mr. Goodwin)were purchased on the very day on a new steamer of the NorthGerman Lloyd, which was to leave Naples on the sixteenth ofDecember. Subsequently, however, their passage wastransferred to the steamer \u201cPrinz Regent Leopold\u201d, as the newsteamer could not sail on that day.As the news of Swamiji\u2019s decision to return to Indiareached the ears of his disciples and admirers, there was muchsadness among them, but they quickly made preparations forfarewell parties, and invited him to speak at functions organizedby them. In its issue of 16 December, the Indian Mirror ofCalcutta published a report of a dinner party given by theCambridge Indian Mejlis on 21 November 1896 at theUniversity Arms Hotel in honour of Prince Runjeet Singhjee,who had saved England\u2019s honour at the Test Match against theAustralians and Mr. (later Sir) Atul Chandra Chatterjee, whohad stood first at the I. C. S. examination (standing first evenin English). At this function Swamiji was present, and at therequest of Mr. Baptista, the Chairman, made a speech inresponse to the toast of \u201cIndia\u201d. We give here the report of thespeech, which appeared in the paper, in full, because it is notto be found in any work on Swamiji\u2019s life known to us andspecially because it was a valuable one. \u201cSwami Vivekanandarose next to respond amidst loud and deafening cheers. TheSwami began by saying  that he did not know exactly why he1143should be chosen to respond to the toast unless it be for thereason that he, in physical bulk, bore a striking resemblance tothe national animal of India (laughter). He desired tocongratulate the guests of the evening, and he took the statementthat Mr. Chatterjee was going to correct the mistakes of thepast historians of India to be literally true. For, out of the pastthe future must come, and he knew no greater and morepermanent foundation for the future than a true knowledge ofwhat had preceded. The present is the effect of infinity of causes,which represent the past. They had many things to learn fromthe Europeans but their past. The glory of India, which hadpassed away, should constitute even a still greater source ofinspiration and instruction. Things rise and things decay, thereis a rise and fall everywhere in the world. And though India isfallen today, she will assuredly rise again (loud cheers). Therewas a time when India produced great philosophers, and stillgreater prophets and preachers. The memory of those days oughtto fill them with hope and confidence. This was not the firsttime in the history of India that they were so low. Periods ofdepression and degradation had occurred before this, but Indiahad always triumphed in the long run and so would she onceagain in the future.\u201dHis disciples and admires arranged a farewell party forhim, which was held at the hall of the Royal Society of Painters,in Piccadilly, on 13 December 1896, the last Sunday before hisdeparture. Mr. E. T. Sturdy presided on the occasion, and allthose who were known to be Swamiji\u2019s followers were presentby invitation at the meeting. In a touching account of the eventgiven in an article contributed to the Brahmavadin , September,1907, Mr. Eric Hammond said inter alia , \u201cAll sorts andconditions of men were there, but all alike were filled by onedesire: to see him, to hear him, even if it may be, to touch hisTHE CALL OF THE MOTHERLANDSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1144garment  once again. . . . Speeches illustrating the esteem andaffection, which Swamiji had won, were made by men andwomen. Salvos of applause punctuated and followed them.Many were silent, tongue-tied and sad at heart. Tears were verynear to some eyes. Grey and gloom without were intensifiedand deepened by grey and gloom within. One form, one figure,fought and triumphed over sorrow; arrayed in garments,glistening as of amber, Swamiji passed among the people, likea living shaft of sunshine. `Yes, Yes,\u2019 he said, `we shall meetagain; we shall.\u2019 In reply to the address that was presented tohim, Swamiji pointed out that history repeats itself and thatChristianity had been rendered possible only by the Romanpeace.\u201d (Sister Nivedita\u2019s comments on this statement havebeen quoted by us above.) He assured them that he would bealways with them, it may not be physically, but in the spiritualconsciousness. It may be mentioned here that he did meet hishearers once again, though not as a teacher, on his way toAmerica in 1899, but as regards his continuing even after deathin the spiritual consciousness, many who are imbued with histeachings always testify. One recalls the statement he made toMr. Hammond shortly before he left London, \u201cI may even findit good to get out of this body, to throw it off like a disusedgarment. But I shall never cease preaching and helping mankinduntil all shall come to know the Highest Truth.\u201d 135Swami Vivekananda delivered one more lecture beforehe left London, entitled \u201cAdvaita Vedanta\u201d. It was the fittingculmination of the whole series of his lectures on Vedanta, asit spoke the final word on the highest stage of Realization. Hewas now fully satisfied with the success that he had achievedin propagating Vedanta in England, rating it even above hisAmerican work. On 28 November 1896 he wrote about this toMary and Harriet Hale as follows, \u201cThe work in London has1145been a roaring success. The English are not so bright as theAmericans, but once you touch their heart, it is yours forever.Slowly have I gained..\u201d 136 In his reply to the address of welcomepresented to him by the citizens of Calcutta on his return, hereverted to the subject, and said as follows, \u201cMy work inEngland has been more satisfactory to me than my work inAmerica.\u201d His few months\u2019 stay in England had, as he said,revolutionized his ideas on the English national character, andin his Calcutta speech he was in high praise of \u201cthe bold, braveand steady Englishman.\u201d They were, he said, \u201ca nation ofheroes, they are the true Kshatriyas; their education is to hidetheir feelings and never to show them.\u201d He declared, \u201cNo manever landed on English soil with more hatred in his heart for arace than I did for the English.. but the more I lived amongthem.. I found where the heartbeat of the nation was, and themore I loved them..\u201dIt is worth repeating again that his revised views on theEnglish national character did not indicate that he had fallenin love with British imperialism, and we have referred morethan once above to his ideas of British rule in India as expressedin a letter to Mary Hale. Be that as it may, here we are concernedmore with his evaluation of the work that he had been able toachieve in England, and he certainly believed that he had donemore to propagate Vedanta in England during his six months\u2019stay in that country than during three years of strenuous laboursin America. Whether he revised this opinion later we are notsure about, but it is a fact that next time when he came to theWest, it was America that he chose as his field of work, notEngland. At the time (1896) also, Vedanta work in that country(America) was going on apace. A number of persons of goodsocial standing and culture had been initiated by the Swami ashis disciples, some actually taking the vows either of sannyasa,or brahmacharya. A Vedanta Society founded in 1895 had beenTHE CALL OF THE MOTHERLANDSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1146recently vitalized and included some devoted souls who hadmade themselves conspicuous by their zeal for spreadingVedantic thought even during the Swami\u2019s absence in England.There had been such a stir throughout America that on the onehand there was a demand for more Indian preachers to carryforward the work done by Swamiji, and on the other thesounding of the alarm note by opponents that Indians wereplanning an \u201caggressive move.\u201d We have referred above to areproduction in The Indian Mirror of 3 July 1896 of a reportthat had warned the people about danger. We give below fullerextracts from this report, since it gives us some idea of theprogress of the Vedanta movement in America at this time,and also, impartially, the views of Americans who were leadingthe movement.\u201cSo successful was Saradananda that another speakerwill come.\u201cEminent converts may be made.\u201cWhen that lordly Hindu monk of India, SwamiVivekananda, left the New World on April 15, it was generallyknown what he had accomplished here in the way of spreadingthe religion of the Hindus, but the study of the philosophy ofthe Vedas has absorbed many persons of prominence, and theimportance, with which this is regarded by the leading lightsof Hinduism in India is evidenced by their decision to dispatchanother disciple, Swami Saradananda, to urge on the missionarywork begun by Vivekananda.\u201cThe aggressive move by the chiefs of the Hindu faithhas just been announced in a letter from the noted SwamiRamakrishnananda, who presides over ( sic ) the AlambazarMath, a suburb of Calcutta. . . . Ramakrishnananda addressed1147himself to the students of Swami Vivekananda, in care ofMiss Phillips. For Miss Phillips, who is prominent among manycircles in woman\u2019s intellectual and charitable world of themetropolis, has been doing much of the correspondence forthe serious body of thinkers, who have been investigating theSwami\u2019s teachings so earnestly. And among these are Dr. Janes,President of the Ethical Society, Mrs. Ole Bull, Emma Thursby,the songstress, Dr. Edward C. Day, Mr. and Mrs. Leggett,Mr. Arthur Smith, Mr. and Mrs. Walter Goodyear, Mrs. Dayand her sister, and nearly a hundred others who, for the present,prefer that their names shall not be too conspicuously connectedwith the investigation.\u201cSwami Ramakrishnananda\u2019s letter begins with aninscription in Sanskrit, but is in English. It is filled withexpressions of gratification over the progress of the Hindureligion there. Vivekananda has already announced that hewould go to London to meet Swami Saradananda.\u201cAnd this letter, said Miss Phillips yesterday, shows withwhat reverence our Swami Vivekananda is held in India. Itrefutes effectually all of the hints that his religious enemieshave tried to spread broadcast, that he was not the realrepresentative of the Hindu monks to this country.\u201cDr. Janes, Mr. Goodyear, Mr. Day and others who werewilling to speak of the faith in this city, said that it had beenmisunderstood by the public in general. `We are not giving upthe religion of our forefathers, nor the Christ of Nazareth,\u2019 theyexplained. `It is a delving to the roots of all religions, leavingus free to worship in whatever form we choose\u2019.\u201cThe meetings of the Circle in the city lagged somewhatsince the departure of Vivekananda but the private researchADIEU, ENGLANDSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1148has continued, and it is expected, Miss Phillips said, will finda substantial following when he arrives in this country.\u201cIt is claimed that the religion of the Vedas was theprimeval religion that has attracted so many students to thesounding of its depths. Vivekananda was the first who had beenable to present this claim in a manner that could convince.\u201cThere have been many Christs, said Miss Phillips. Allrepresent the fundamental principles of the philosophy of theVedas. Calvin, Luther, Swedenborg and the makers of religioushistory, founded their faiths on the same principles. So, studyingthis fundamental faith, we hold that we are only gatheringinformation, so that we may better understand the religion ofJesus of Nazareth.\u201dThe Swami was fully aware that the seed of Vedanta thatthey had sown on American soil had sprouted into a vigoroussapling, that he had left in that country sincere and activefollowers who were tending it, and was confident that it wasbound ere long to develop into a perennial plant. \u201cHe knewthat the work would go on well under Swami Abhedananda.\u201d137 In England he did not choose to speak much about hisAmerican work, and even \u2014 no doubt to hearten workers inthat country, among other reasons \u2014 compared the successachieved in America rather unfavourably with his achievementin London. When he sailed for home on 16 December 1896 hehad reasons for being satisfied with the work he had done inthe West \u2014 on both shores of the Atlantic, \u2014 a great workjudged by any standards. His friends were heavyhearted but,as Mr. Sturdy said, his influence had already sunk very deep,and they were resolved to go straight ahead with the work,expecting to be helped considerably by Swami Abhedananda,whom Swamiji had left in London for the purpose.

Said he, \u201cAfter the first session of the Parliament of Religions, Iwent to the Restaurant in the basement of the Art Institute, and I said to him,`What shall I get you to eat?\u2019 His reply was, `Give me beef\u2019 ( Indian Newspapers, cited, 201).\u201d This, like other accusations made by Dr. Barrows against Swamiji,such as that he had slandered American women, would sound as palpably falseto everybody who would examine them in the light of common sense. Swamijitreated them with contempt and, in accordance with his practice, refrainedfrom issuing a public denial. When an anonymous correspondent sent him aclipping from the Indian Mirror that contained a reproduction of the relevantparagraph in the American paper, he simply passed it on to Swami Brahmanandaalong with his \u201canswer to the passages which are damned lies.\u201d ( Vide his letterto Swami Suddhananda dated 15 September, 1897.

Swamiji\u2019senemies sought to make capital out of his wild statements as part of theiropposition to this mission of reform and regeneration of Hinduism.

He observed, \u201cMr. Sturdy should have knownBuddhism was founded on the solid basis of the Holy Brotherhood.\u201dIt seems to us that Mr. Sturdy\u2019s letter deserves more attention from thestudents of the history of the Vedanta movement in England. It seems to give apartial answer to the question that is frequently asked, \u201cWhy did not the Vedantamovement take a solid root in England as it did in America?\u201d The followers ofSwamiji in England, as Mr. Sturdy\u2019s letter seems to suggest, were not quitefavourable to the idea of organizing the movement by such methods as settingup a Society for the purpose. Mr. Sturdy was perhaps also opposed to Swamiji\u2019ssuggestion that there should be some \u201crituals,\u201d as we learn from Swamiji\u2019sletters to him dated 31 October and 2 November ( C.W ., cited, VII 356, 358).29 The Master As I Saw Him , cited, 12-13.30 Ibid , 3-5.31 Reminiscences , cited, second edition, 137.32 Prabuddha Bharata , April, 1963.33 Ibid .34 C.W ., cited, VI, 377.35 The Life , cited, II, 412.36 Indian Newspapers , cited, 89.SWAMI VIVEKANANDA1152C.W ., cited, VIII, 361.38 The Life , cited, II, 413.39 Prabuddha Bharata , April, 1963.40 The date of this letter is wrongly given C.W ., VI, 355 as 16December 1895.41 Reminiscences , cited, 216-17.42 C.W ., cited, VIII, 356.43 Ibid , 358.

A touchingstory bespeaking Swami Ramakrishnananda\u2019s love for Swamiji and theirdevotion to each other was narrated by Swamiji in a Letter to Sister Niveditadated Benares Cantonment date 4 March 1902 after returning from his secondjourney to the West. Swamiji was lying seriously ill at Belur Math a few weeksbefore he left for Benares. Sasi came from Madras to meet him at Belur, andthe first thing he did was to lay down at the Swami\u2019s feet Rs.400.00 which hehad collected in his many years of hard work. Swamiji was touched beyondwords at this mark of love and devotion of his beloved gurubhai and couldhardly restrain his tears.66 C.W ., cited, VII, 479_86, Vani O Rachana , cited, VII, 239-244.67 Londone Swami Vivekananda, cited, I, Calcutta, 1363 B.S., 89,93.68 The Indian Mirror , Calcutta, Thursday, 25 June 1896.69 Londone Swami Vivekananda , cited, I, 101.70 Reminiscences , cited, 303.

They greatlysympathized with me; I think that about thirty English Church clergymen entirelyagree with me on all points of discussion. I was agreeably surprised to find thatthe English clergymen, though they differed from me, did not abuse me behindmy back and stab me in the dark. This is because of caste and hereditary culture.\u201dHe also said, \u201cMissionaries were nowhere in England.

Max Muller seems to have receivedaltogether \u00a332,000 for bringing out this work \u2014 a truly unprecedented gift. Itdoes not detract from the merit of the East India Company in making this vastexpenditure even if one has to admit that political considerations weighed withthem somewhat in doing so. The Directors of the Company, all hardheadedbusinessmen, only agreed to it when Bunsen informed them that this greatsacred book of their subjects would be taken up for publication by a Germanpublisher of Konigsberg if they did not finance it, and that in that eventualityEngland would suffer a great national disgrace.The size of the monetary help that Max Muller received in bringing outthis work roused the jealousy of his brother scholars in England and America,some of whom alleged that the work was not all his own, or even that it was nothis at all. The New York Nation wrote. \u201cA German scholar (Rosen) did thework, and Muller appropriated the credit for it.\u201d It went to the length of sayingthat he hired Aufrecht to do the work that he himself had been hired to do.Even Prof. E. B. Cowley, who had the most balanced opinion on the subject,said that the editing of the RigVeda was not Max Muller\u2019s \u201cpreeminent work\u201dand that other works, such as his History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature , showed\u201cmore clearly his real genius and original powers\u201d.In India, however, the work was received with wide and almostunqualified approval. At a great assembly at Poona, orthodox Pandits used itto correct their own MSS. (It is amusing that it had to be read out to them,since allegedly the ink used in printing it had cow\u2019s blood mixed in it!) RajaRadhakanta Deb, the leader of the orthodox Hindus of Bengal, hailed it asfurnishing \u201cthe Vaidic Pandits with a complete collection of the holy Samhitaof the first Veda , only detached portions of which are to be found in thepossession of a few of them.\u201d We have already spoken about SwamiVivekananda\u2019s appreciation of the work.We may mention in this connection that when, in 1890_92, a new editionof the work was published, the British Government reversed the decision oftheir predecessors (the East India Company) and refused any monetary helpfor the publication. Thereupon, it is heartening to know, an Indian prince cameforward to contribute more than \u00a34,000 for a complete  and revised secondedition. (Nirad C.

            "data": "SWAMI VIVEKANANDA1158To reduce the length of the voyage and perhaps also so that theAtlantic, of which at least once he had an unpleasant experience,might be avoided, the Swami\u2019s loving friends. Mrs. and CaptainSevier, who were to accompany him to India, had decided thatthey should take the boat at Naples. So, while Mr. Goodwinset sail from Southampton, intending to join them at Naples,Swami Vivekananda with his two companions boarded aDovergoing train at London on 16 December 1897, with thegood wishes of his English friends who had come to the stationto see him off. With a sense of successful work done in Englandand looking forward shortly to be back home, the Swami wasin high spirits, even though his body bore the marks of the toiland strain it had gone through ever since he had left India\u2019sshores about three and a half years ago. Captain and Mrs. Sevierwere also looking forward expectantly to doing some serviceto him in India, especially in founding a Himalayan asramawhich was very dear to his heart. They kept the Swami cheerfulwith their pleasant talks as their train travelled on throughFrance and across the Alps, till they reached Milan. His stay inItaly, which he was visiting for the first time, was necessarilyshort, but he enjoyed it, the days being spent in seeing the worksof architecture and other objects of art in the cities where theyhalted, e.g., the cathedral at Milan, the leaning tower at Pisa,Leonardo Da Vinci\u2019s celebrated painting, \u201cThe Last Supper\u201d,and the many places of historic interest and works of art at1159Florence. At Florence, he had the happiness of a chance meetingwith Mrs. and Mr. Hale, who were at the time on a tour ofItaly. A week was spent in Rome visiting the remains of itsancient greatness \u2014 his friends wondering at his knowledgeof ancient history which made these remains objects of livinginterest to him and to them. He was happy to meet AlbertaSturges, a daughter of Mrs. Betty Leggett (elder sister ofMiss Josephine MacLeod), whom, as we know, SwamiVivekananda addressed as mother. The young lady (later LadySandwich), of whom Swamiji was very fond, was at this timeliving with a Miss Edwards, whose address Mrs. Sevier hadgot from Miss MacLeod. Miss Edwards also expressed herwonder at his immense knowledge of Roman history, as sheaccompanied him on his visits to historic places in the EternalCity.It was Christmas time, and the approaches to the churchesthat they visited, which were crowded with stalls where cheaparticles including toys and pictures of the Bambino (image ofthe infant Jesus sitting in his mother\u2019s lap) were sold, had theappearance of melas (fairs) in India. The Swami was happy asthey brought back to his mind his similar experiences in India,and even the liturgy in the churches which he witnessed in thecompany of his friends pleased him since he found in them aresemblance to religious ceremonies in India. While, however,he was attending the ceremony of High Mass at St. Peter\u2019swith Mr. and Mrs. Sevier, he became after a time restless andhe whispered to them, \u201cIs it possible that the Church thatpractises such display, pomp and gorgeous ceremonial is reallythe follower of the lowly Jesus who had nowhere to lay hishead?\u201d (As we know, a similar doubt had assailed his mindearlier in America, at Detroit on 29 February 1894 \u2014 and hehad exclaimed, \u201cAll this prosperity, all this from Christ! ThoseTHE JOURNEY HOMEWARDSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1160who call upon Christ care for nothing but to amass riches! Christwould not find a stone on which to lay his head among you.You are not Christians. Return to Christ!\u201d) However, a fewdays later, when he visited the excavated ruins of Pompeii,destroyed by the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in 79 A.D., his mindwas freed from such depressing thoughts and took delight atthe sight of material prosperity that man had achieved even inthe distant past. Comparing the glory that was the RomanEmpire and modern greatness, he wrote Mary Hale on 3 January1897 from his ship, PrinzRegent Leopold, as follows: \u201cI enjoyedRome more than anything in the West, and after seeing PompeiiI have lost all regard for the so-called `Modern Civilisation\u2019.With the exception of steam and electricity they had everythingelse and infinitely more art conceptions and executions thanthe Moderns.\u201d 1The ship left Naples on 30 December 1896 and thoughthere was rough weather for a few days shortly after she weighedanchor, the Swami continued to be in excellent spirits and hadperfect rest. The voyage, on the whole, was uneventful, exceptfor one or two happenings, which we may briefly narrate. Onenight, while the ship was still on her way to Port Said, theSwami had a curious dream. An old and bearded man appearedbefore him, saying, \u201cObserve well this place that I show toyou. You are now in the island of Crete. This is the land inwhich Christianity began.\u201d In support of this origin ofChristianity, the speaker gave two words \u2014 one of which wasTherapeutic \u2014 and showed both to be derived from Sanskritroots. Sister Nivedita, who gives us this story, 2 says that SwamiVivekananda frequently spoke of his dream in after years andalways gave the two etymologies. Therapeutae means the sonsor disciples of the theras, being derived from \u201c thera \u201c(an elderamong the Buddhist monks), and \u201cputra\u201d meaning a son. The1161other word, says Sister Nivedita, was possibly Essene, theSanskrit derivation of which, however, she could not remember.If Swami Vivekananda had heard the old man uttering the word\u201cEssene\u201d and giving its Sanskrit derivation, it is regrettablethat the latter was \u201clost,  beyond recovery,\u201d for, in spite ofmuch research on the subject, the exact derivation of the wordhas not been ascertained, the most likely one, according to someWestern scholars, being from the Hebrew word \u201cHashsha\u2019im\u201d,meaning the silent ones. The word \u201cTherapeutae\u201d is usuallyconsidered as derived from the Greek word, \u201ctherapeutai\u201d,literally \u201cattendants\u201d or \u201cphysicians,\u201d hence meaning\u201cworshippers of God.\u201d However, Philo, who is the sole authorityfor the existence of the Therapeutae, was unable to account forthe origin of the word. 3 The Sanskrit derivation of \u201cEssene\u201d,which was possibly suggested by the old man in Swamiji\u2019sdream, might be the correct one.The more interesting part of the dream was the beardedold man\u2019s declaration that no such person as Jesus Christ everexisted and that the truths and ideals of the Therapeutaes\u2019 creedwere given out by the Christians as having been taught by Jesus.He also said that the correctness of what he said could beestablished if excavations were carried out there. As the oldman faded out, Swamiji\u2019s sleep broke and rushing to the deckand finding a ship\u2019s officer standing there, he asked him,\u201cWhere are we? What is the time?\u201d The answers were \u2014 justfifty miles off Crete and midnight. The Swami, in whose minddoubts about Jesus Christ\u2019s historicity 4 had never arisen, wasnow set a thinking about it and on the question of the origins ofChristianity. He seems later to have held that more has to betold about the origin of Christianity than what is said in theGospels and that at Alexandria (to the region round which theTherapeutae belonged) a meeting had taken place of IndianTHE JOURNEY HOMEWARDSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1162and Egyptian elements which contributed considerably towardsthe moulding of Christianity. He does not, however, seem tohave given much thought to the Cretan origin of Christianity,to which, according to The Life 5 some excavations in the islandafter the Swami\u2019s  death lent some credence, but which so faras we could make out, is ignored by modern researchers.In any case, Swami Vivekananda\u2019s belief in the avatarhood of Jesus Christ and his love of the Son of Mary were notin the least affected by his dream. Two instances have beencited by Sister Nivedita (and in The Life ) in support of thisand they are worth quoting here. On one occasion, beingrequested by a disciple to give his blessing to a picture of theSistine Madonna, he touched the feet of the Divine Childinstead. On another occasion, in answer to an enquirer, he said,\u201cHad I lived in Palestine in the days of Jesus of Nazareth, Iwould have washed His feet, not with my tears but with myheart\u2019s blood.\u201d 6 In his attitude to Jesus, says Sister Nivedita,the Swami had the explicit sanction of Sri Ramakrishna, whoin reply to a similar question, had said, \u201cDo you not think thatthey who could create such things must themselves have beenthe ideal that they held up for worship?\u201dAs the ship passed through the Suez Canal the Swamiwas physically leaving Europe behind and Asia was possessinghim. He had a curious feeling about this, and in his letter toMary Hale (referred to above), he wrote, \u201cFrom Suez beginsAsia. Once more Asia. What am I? Asiatic, European, orAmerican? I feel a curious medley of personalities in me.\u201d Inspite of what he said, playfully, to his `sister\u2019, Mary, it was theAsian, or rather the Indian, personality in him that was nowmanifesting itself clearly before his companions on board theship, as two small events, which we shall narrate here, indicate.One happened when the ship touched Aden which, though1163geographically a part of Arabia, politically belonged to India,being under the administrative control of Bombay, and standsat the entrance to the Arabian Sea (an arm of the Indian Ocean)that washes the western shore of the Indian peninsula. Whilevisiting the  objects of interest at this place, in the company ofhis disciples, he espied a man smoking his hookah andimmediately ran to him. Addressing him as \u201c Bhai \u201c (brother),he entered into a conversation with him, oblivious of his Englishfriends, who were getting impatient. Seeing the latterapproaching them, he hastily told his new friend, who was aHindusthani betel leaf seller, \u201cBrother, do give me your pipe.\u201dMr. Sevier who had overheard him, found him comfortablyseated with the Indian, chatting with him intimately and puffingat the pipe with great glee. \u201cSo, that\u2019s why you ran away fromus!\u201d said he, with a loud laugh, meaning that he had found hisIndian bhai and his hookah and consequently forgotten them.Mr. Sevier used afterwards to narrate this story to the Swami\u2019sfriends, adding, \u201cI shall never forget that ingenuous look onhis face when he said with childlike sweetness, `Brother, dogive me your pipe,\u2019\u201d When the betel leaf seller learned who hewas, he fell at his feet \u2014 the first Indian to do SwamiVivekananda homage on his return to the motherland.The other story, which shows the Swami in an entirelydifferent mood, may be briefly told. In his ship there were twoChristian padres who, in season and out of season, insisted onhaving a conversation with him. They had only one topic, therelative merits of Hinduism and Christianity and the superiorityof the latter. They were beaten on every point, and then theybecame violent and abusive. The Swami stood it as long aspossible but one day they passed the limits of ordinary decency,whereupon he suddenly walked close to one of them, seizedhim quietly and firmly by the collar, and said, half humorouslyTHE JOURNEY HOMEWARDSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1164and half grimly, \u201cIf you abuse my religion again, I\u2019ll throw youoverboard.\u201d The man shook in his boots in fright and said,\u201cLet me go, sir, I shall never do it again.\u201d During the rest of thejourney, he and his friend behaved like gentlemen. Narratingthis story once to Priyanath Sinha, a friend of his boyhood, theSwami asked, \u201cIf a man insulted your mother, what would youdo?\u201d \u201cI shall fall upon him and teach him a lesson,\u201d Sinhareplied. The Swami said, \u201cI wish you had the same positivefeeling for the true mother of our country \u2014 our own religion.Every day the Christian missionaries are abusing Hinduism toyour faces and your brothers are being converted intoChristianity. How can you bear to see all this? Where is yourfaith? Where is your patriotism?\u201d 7IISwami Vivekananda knew that his countrymen were proud thathe had successfully carried out his mission in the West andthat a grand reception awaited him on his return to themotherland. He was, however, quite unaware of the greatpreparations which had been made to receive him in many citiesin Ceylon besides Colombo and in almost every city in SouthernIndia besides Madras. His own plan was, after the reception atColombo, \u201cto `do\u2019 Ceylon a bit\u201d 8 and then take a steamer directfrom Colombo to Madras. 9 He had a great work to do in India,for which his programme was ready and he had expected thathe would be able to start working on it immediately on hisarrival. As we know, his strenuous toils in the West had takena heavy toll of his health, and though he had possibly somewhatrecouped it during the voyage, what he needed most was rest.It is sad to know, as we do from his letter to Mary Hale writtenabout a year earlier, that he really thought that he would getthis rest in India. On 10 February 1896, he had written to her,1165\u201cNow I am longing for rest. Hope I will get some and the Indianpeople will give me up. How I would like to become dumb forsome years and not talk at all. I was not made for these strugglesand fights of the world.\u201d 10 It seems also that his original planwas to stay for only a short time in India and then return toEurope and America. On 2 December 1896 (about two weeksbefore he left England), he had written to Miss JosephineMacLeod, \u201cWell, the good old country now calls me. I mustgo. . . . I just set things a going a little in India and am off againfor the ever beautiful U.S. and England, etc.\u201d 11Yet, earlier, when he was still physically fit and cares ofhealth had not begun to disturb his mind, at Detroit, once whilehe was talking with some disciples about the difficulties hehad met in presenting Hinduism to the Americans, he hadexpressed different hopes about the reception of his ideas andof himself in India. He had said, \u201cIndia must listen to me! Ishall shake India to her foundations! I shall send an electricthrill through her national veins! Wait! You shall see how Indiawill receive me. It is India, my own India, that knows trulyhow to appreciate that which I have given so freely here withmy life\u2019s blood, as the spirit of Vedanta. India will receive mein triumph.\u201d 12 And when the hour of his triumphant receptionby his countrymen actually came, broken as he was in hisphysical health beyond repair (he had hardly four and a halfyears of life left) he rose to the occasion, and in a spirit ofhumility and fully aware of its significance, received thespontaneous homage of his fellow countrymen.It has been said that he was received as a \u201cconqueringhero,\u201d meaning that his reception was an appreciation of thefact that he had stormed the citadel of Western materialismand placed on it firmly and securely the banner of IndianHAIL, INDIA\u2019S NOBLE SON!SWAMI VIVEKANANDA1166spiritualism. It has been said also that thereby Indian nationalpride had been roused, the reception given to him being theexpression of that not very innocuous sentiment. Even if it was,at least in part, so, it is understandable how a nation in bondagecould react in that manner to Swami Vivekananda\u2019s triumphsin the West. On a careful perusal of the addresses of  welcomethat were presented to him from Colombo to Almora, one,however, finds that the predominating sentiments that lay inthe minds that formulated them were different. Oft repeated inthese are, mainly, the following: thankfulness for his trueexposition of the truths contained in India\u2019s sacred books, thusdisabusing the minds of Westerners of their prejudices, andbringing home to his fellow countrymen the value of theirglorious heritage, thankfulness in particular for having drawnthe attention of the West to the characteristic Hindu doctrineof Harmony and Brotherhood of Religions and the Hindu idealof a universal religion, and above all, best wishes for the successof the great movement initiated by him for the propagationand revival of Indian religion and philosophy.  References werealso made to the success achieved by him as the result of havingproved the capability of Hinduism to provide a basis for auniversal religion, in bringing the West and the East nearer toeach other and thus even paving the path for humanbrotherhood. 13We shall now give a brief account of SwamiVivekananda\u2019s reception by his countrymen. As the ship castanchor in Colombo harbour on 15 January 1897, SwamiNiranjanananda, who had already reached the place to receivehim, and Mr. T. Harrison, a Buddhist resident of Colombo, asrepresenting the Reception Committee, immediately went onboard the vessel and accorded him a hearty welcome. 14 Thelanding, for which a steam launch had been kept ready, took1167place in the evening, in the midst of tumultuous cheers ofthousands, collected on the beach. The Hon\u2019ble P.Coomaraswamy, Member of Legislative Council of Ceylon,who headed the reception, stepped forward and garlanded himwith a beautiful jasmine wreath. The enthusiasm of the crowdwas so great that there was a rush, and the Swami was hastilyput in a carriage which was in readiness for him. He soonreached the pandal in Barnes Street which had been  erectedthere for his reception, and whither the entire crowd, using allavailable conveyances of the city, or on foot, followed him.Thence he walked to another pandal in front of the bungalowthat had been prepared for his temporary residence in CinnamonGardens, a distance of about a quarter of a mile. There too thevast crowd followed him, mostly on foot. Needless to say, thesepandals as also a triumphal arch that had been erected at thefront of Barnes Street and bore a motto of welcome to theSwami were very artistically prepared. The fact, however, isworth mentioning that the decorations were all in indigenousstyle and that the Swami walking in procession was attendedwith the Hindu honours \u2014 the flag, the sacred umbrella, thespreading of the white cloth. As soon as the Swami entered thesecond pandal , a beautiful artificial flower unfolded its petalsand a bird flew out. None, however, cared to look at and admirethe decorations, which were damaged in the struggle to havea near view of him.After the Swami had taken his seat and silence had beenrestored, a musician played a charming air on his violin, thesacred Tamil hymns, the \u201cThevaram\u201d, two thousand years old,were sung and a Sanskrit hymn composed specially in theSwami\u2019s honour was intoned. Then Mr. Coomaraswamy rose,bowed to the Swami in the oriental fashion and read out theaddress. We need not quote it here and may simply mentionHAIL, INDIA\u2019S NOBLE SON!SWAMI VIVEKANANDA1168that it contained the ideas and sentiments outlined by us aboveas forming the substance of most of the addresses that theSwami received on his return to India. The Swami\u2019s reply wentbeyond the words of conventional thanksgiving for the welcomegiven to him and, brief as it was, contained the kernel of themessage that, from many platforms, he was now to give to hispeople. Disclaiming any personal character in the welcome hehad received, he pointed out that it had been accorded not to agreat politician, or to a  great soldier, or to a millionaire, but toa begging sannyasin. This, said he, was possible only in India,and there because Indians considered religion to have thehighest value in life. He concluded by urging them to makereligion the backbone of their lives. Those who listened to theSwami were so captivated that they hung on outside thebungalow which he had entered after his speech and dispersedonly after he came out and after the manner of sannyasis salutedthem and blessed them.The Swami stayed for four days at Colombo, duringwhich the bungalow occupied by him was thronged with visitorsat all possible hours of day and night. It became, indeed, aplace of pilgrimage for men and women of all classes andstations in life, rich and poor, from the highest officials of thestate to the poorest of the poor. In the evening of the next day(16 January 1897), he delivered his first public lecture in theEast, the theme of which was \u201cIndia, the Punyabhumi \u201c. Hebegan with saying that if there was a land on earth which couldlay claim to be the blessed Punyabhumi , it was India. Heasserted, \u201cHence have proceeded the tidal waves of philosophythat have covered the earth, East or West, North or South, andhence again must start the wave which is going to spiritualizethe material civilization of the West.\u201d It is impossible to givehere even a bare summary of this lecture, which thrilled his1169listeners, giving them an idea of the vastness of scholarship,the loftiness of thought, the command of the English languageand the eloquence of the great Swami Vivekananda.The following day, 17 January 1897, the Swami wasagain visited in his bungalow by numerous visitors till eveningwhen he paid a visit to the temple of Siva. The entire route tothe temple was lined with people eager to have a glimpse ofhim as he went to it in a carriage, which was stopped frequentlyby people who presented him with fruits, or garlanded him, orsprinkled rosewater on him. As was the custom in SouthernIndia, lights were burned and fruits were placed in front ofhouses on both sides of the streets through which the carriagepassed, especially in Checku Street, the heart of the Tamilquarter of Colombo. At the temple, he was greeted with shoutsof \u201cJaya Mahadeva\u201d, the idea having perhaps already gainedcurrency (as we shall find that it did in Madras) that he was anincarnation of Sambandha Moorthy, a Saiva saint. 15 Whenthe Swami returned to his bungalow, he found there assembleda number of Brahmins with whom he conversed till half pasttwo the following morning. The next day the Swami visitedthe house of Mr. Chelliah, and the same scenes were reenactedas he passed through the streets leading to that house \u2014thousands lining them and showering garlands and flowers onhim and sprinkling Ganga water on him. Here the Swamidistributed sacred ashes which all received with joy. A pictureof Sri Ramakrishna having attracted his attention at the house,he immediately got up and reverently bowed down to it. In theevening the Swami delivered a second lecture at the PublicHall, the subject being Vedanta philosophy and the centraltheme the advocacy of a universal religion. The Swami\u2019sattention being drawn to the fact that many of his listeners hadappeared in European dress, he gently cautioned them againstGRAND RECEPTIONS AT COLOMBOSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1170slavishly imitating Westerners in their ways of life. (In hisMemoirs of European Travel Swami Vivekananda had someharsh words to say about the appearance and dress of theCeylonese.) 16As we have said above, it was in the Swami\u2019s plan to seea little of Ceylon during his visit to that country. Ceylon wasknown to him, since boyhood, as Lanka, the land of theRakshasas, whose king, Ravana, had, according to theRamayana, stolen Sita, wife of Ramachandra, the hero of thatgreat epic, who had invaded the country with his monkey hostsafter crossing  the sea by a bridge constructed by him and theremnants of which are believed to be Adam\u2019s bridge. TheCeylonese, of course, totally reject the story, on the groundthat in their country there is not even a tradition to indicate it,and we may be sure that the Swami was aware that there wereno archaeological evidences to support it. The Swami, however,took an interest in the story, narrated in the ancient BuddhistChronicle, the Mahavamsa , of Vijayasimha, son of a king ofBengal, who in 504 B.C., had landed on the coast of Ceylon,accompanied by his followers, and was the first king of Ceylon.(According to some scholars, he was not a Bengali but aGujarati.) Of much greater interest to him was the Buddhisticperiod of Ceylon\u2019s history, which was inaugurated with thecoming in 288 B.C. to Anuradhapura, the then capital, ofMahinda, a son or brother of the Emperor Asoka, who convertedthe king, the queen, and the officials of the kingdom, to befollowed by the subjects, to Buddhism. Buddhism ever sincehas been the religion of the vast majority of the people ofCeylon. Mahinda is said to have planted at Anuradhapura asapling of the sacred Bo tree, seated beneath the shade of whichGautama attained to Buddhahood. In 1897, the year of theSwami\u2019s visit, the tree was, therefore, 2,125 years old, and1171was the oldest tree in the world recorded in history. SwamiVivekananda longed to visit Anuradhapura, which in the daysof its glory was the Rome of the Orient, and which stillcontained the relics of the past, the area in which they are foundbeing vaster than any similar one in the world, including modernRome. He was also anxious to visit Kandy, which was thecapital of the last independent kingdom of Ceylon, and stillcontains the famous temple in which a tooth of Buddha waspreserved. (The Portuguese claim that during their suzeraintyover Ceylon, 1517_1600, they captured the original tooth andburned it in the marketplace at Goa. The reader may recall,however, that in a speech at Detroit in 1894, SwamiVivekananda  had referred to this exploit and that his audienceroared with laughter when he said that what they had destroyedwas not the original tooth but a fake, which was a foot long!)After he had reached Colombo and conferred withMr. Coomaraswamy and others, the Swami agreed to asubstantial alteration of his tour programme. It seems that on17 January 1897, or perhaps a little earlier, a request had beenreceived from the Raja of Ramnad to the effect that the Swamimay visit Rameswar, which was in his territory, on his way toMadras. 17 The Swami readily agreed to this, possibly because,as he stated later in his reply to the welcome address at Ramnad,he accepted the validity of the argument that had been advancedin support of the request. It was that, as the Raja had been thefirst to put the idea of going to the Parliament of Religions intohis head, he should first land on his territory on his return toIndia. There were a few other reasons why the original plan ofhis tour could not be adhered to. Invitations were coming tohim from many places for a visit, even for a few hours, andthough it was physically impossible for him to accept all ofthem, the one coming from Jaffna, which after Colombo hadGRAND RECEPTIONS AT COLOMBOSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1172the largest Hindu population among the cities of Ceylon, couldnot be ignored. Then there was the Swami\u2019s strong desire thathe should see something of the sites of Ceylon\u2019s ancientgreatness, especially Kandy and Anuradhapura. In considerationof all these, it was decided that he should first proceed to Kandy,which was fifty miles to the east of Colombo by rail, thence toAnuradhapura, which was about 75 miles to the north of it, byroad and finally journey to Jaffna, which was still another 125miles to the north \u2014 doing this also by road. On 17 January1897, the Raja of Ramnad was informed that the Swami wouldvisit Ramnad on 27 January. The Raja was in the ecstasy ofdelight to receive the news, and immediately fed a thousandpoor. 18True to the new programme, the Swami reached Kandyby train in a special saloon on the morning of 19 January 1897.Thousands had gathered to receive him at the station, an addressof welcome was presented to him, and he gave a suitable reply.After a little rest, during which he visited the temple of theSacred Tooth and other objects of interest, he resumed hisjourney, reaching Metale in the evening. Thence the roadjourney began. A few miles beyond Dambool, there was anaccident, one of the front wheels of his coach getting smashedwhile it was descending a hill, though fortunately not comingentirely off, in which case the coach might have overturned. Ittook three hours to procure another conveyance which wasonly a bullock cart. In this was put Mrs. Sevier and the luggage,the Swami and his companions having had to walk a numberof miles before other bullock carts could be had. They passedthe night in the carts and reached Anuradhapura on thefollowing day, about eight hours late. Here the Swami spenthours seeing the ruins of the ancient city \u2014 huge stupas andstone buildings \u2014 and in contemplation of the Prince of1173Ahimsa, to whom, as we know, he had given his heart\u2019s devotionsince his childhood and whose message he had delivered inmany lecture meetings of his in America. At this place, however,he was rudely brought back to a sense of the realities of howthe noble religion was practiced by the adherents in modernCeylon. This happened when in the afternoon, standing underthe shade of the celebrated Bo tree (about which we have spokenabove), he had hardly begun addressing a meeting of abouttwo to three thousand people who had gathered there to hearhim. A whole host of fanatical Buddhists, Bhikshus andhouseholders, men, women and children, suddenly invaded theplace and created an awful uproar by beating drums, cymbals,etc., with a view to breaking up the meeting. A serious riotmight have resulted, had it not been for the persuasive appealof the Swami to the Hindus \u201cto practise a bit of nonviolence ifthey did not.\u201d 19The scandalous behaviour of the Buddhists ofAnuradhapura towards one who was not a whit behind anyone among them in revering the Great Master and who at themoment was an honoured guest at their city deserves to becondemned. It is probable, however, that there were some otherfactors, besides religious fanaticism, to account for it. Therewas, for example, the antipathy of the native Sinhalese, whowere mostly Buddhists, to Tamil settlers in Ceylon, a powerfulminority community, mostly professing Hinduism, whodominated Ceylonese economy. As we have seen, the Buddhistshad mustered strong on the sea beach in Colombo to offer awelcome to the Swami, and freely intermingled in the crowdsthere. But much of the enthusiasm displayed in subsequentcelebrations was to be found among the Tamilians, whopredominated in the population of Colombo and were Hindus.It may be noted that the addresses of welcome that wereGRAND RECEPTIONS AT COLOMBOSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1174Colombo, January, 18971175Colombo, January, 1897SWAMI VIVEKANANDA1176presented to the Swami at Colombo and Jaffna were in thename of the Hindu community. With the undercurrent ofreligious and/or racial feeling, always existing in Ceylon, it iseasy to understand how there could be a flare-up at apredominatingly Buddhistic place like Anuradhapura. In anycase, however, it indicated how far the modern votaries ofBuddhism in Ceylon had departed from the teachings of thePrince of Peace and Nonviolence. In a letter to Mrs. Ole Bulldated 5 May 1897, Swami Vivekananda wrote about the subjectas follows: \u201cI am perfectly convinced that what they callModern Hinduism with all its ugliness is only strandedBuddhism. . As for the ancient form which the Buddhapreached, I have the greatest respect for it, as well as for Hisperson. And you well know that we Hindus worship him as anIncarnation. Neither is the Buddhism of Ceylon any good. Myvisit to Ceylon has  entirely disillusioned me. . The only respectthat the Buddhists pay to their great tenet of nonkilling is byopening butcher stalls in every place. And the priests encouragethis. The real Buddhism I once thought of, would yet do muchgood .\u201d 20The journey to Jaffna was a strenuous one, both the horsesand the roads being bad and, it seems, was done at breakneckspeed. (If, as we learn from The Life , the party reached Jaffnaon a Sunday, it did so on 24 January 1897 which fell on aSunday. The 125 miles from Anuradhapura, which they left onthe morning of 21 January, or perhaps in the evening of20 January were thus done in about four days, which meansthat they were travelling about 30 miles every day.) How thesponsors of the tour could think of a journey of this nature byroad when a much less arduous one by rail could be easilyarranged is difficult to understand. Perhaps, as the Swamiseemed to be in the best of health and actually was in highspirits, they could have no idea of the real state of his health.1177We are told that the tedium of the journey was much relievedby the sight of the lovely scenery of hill and jungle throughwhich the path lay. That was possibly so, but it did tell on theSwami\u2019s health. As one of his companions remarked, \u201cHe wouldhave been killed with kindness if he had stayed longer inCeylon.\u201d As we shall presently see, during the succeeding days,and especially during what was the holy Navaratra for hisadmirers in Madras, he was on the verge of a collapse and acatastrophe was averted only because he left for Calcuttaabruptly.However, in the early morning of 24 January 1897 abouta hundred persons, the elite of the Hindu society of Jaffna hadcome to Uppar, ten miles from that place, expecting to be ableto welcome the Swami the sooner. As the coach carrying himdid not arrive till 9 a.m. they went two miles further ahead,when suddenly they sighted him coming by the mail coach.A procession was immediately formed, with the Swami,Swami Niranjanananda, and Mr. Nagalingam Pillai, Agent,C.S.S. Company (who was accompanying the Swami fromColombo) in the first carriage and the rest (about 2000 strong)in 20 carriages, or on foot, and reached the town at about 11.30a.m. At 8.30 p.m., the Swami was taken in another grandprocession to the Hindu College, a distance of two miles, thewhole route being illumined and decorated. The scene wasunprecedented \u2014 fifteen thousand persons, Hindus, Buddhists,Christians, Muhammadans, taking part and all being on footexcept the Swami and his party. As at Colombo, at the doorstepsof the houses on both sides of the road through which he passed,as the custom went, Niraikundam 21 and lamps were placed,while his carriage was frequently stopped by people whogarlanded him and offered him fruits, etc. When, at about 10.30p.m., the procession reached the College, in front of which aTHE SWAMI AT ANURADHAPURASWAMI VIVEKANANDA1178great pandal had been erected, the Swami was escorted to thedais and garlanded by Mr. Chellappa Pillai, the retired ChiefJustice of Travancore. A welcome address was presented, towhich the Swami replied in an eloquent and stirring speech forabout an hour. In the evening of the following day, at 7 p.m.,he again spoke at the same place, the subject being\u201cVedantism\u201d. The speech lasted an hour and forty minutes.On Tuesday, 26 January 1897, the Swami left Jaffna bya boat, accompanied by his European disciples, for PambanRoad, which was fifty miles across the Palk Strait, which, alongwith the Gulf of Manaar, separates Ceylon from India. After adelightful voyage \u2014 the weather being fine \u2014 the Swamiarrived at Pamban Road at about 3 p.m., when a party of therespectable gentry of the place came on board the vessel andaccorded him a hearty welcome. They requested him to deferlanding, since the Raja of Ramnad was expected shortly toarrive to receive  him. Punctual to the hour, at 5 p.m., the Rajaarrived in a nice, neatly decorated boat, specially prepared forthe occasion. The Swami was transferred to this boat, and assoon as he entered it the Raja and all his staff prostratedthemselves, lengthwise, before him. The Raja then placed himon a throne like seat and put sandals at his feet, remarking that\u201che deemed it a high honour and privilege to have been in aposition to do this than to wear the richest diadem on his head.\u201d22 At the landing place a grand pandal had been erected and atemporary jetty put up where a large crowd had assembled.Swami Vivekananda was conducted to a beautiful platform inthe pandal by the Raja who, after a brief speech in which heoffered a hearty welcome to him, asked Mr. Nagalingam toread out the address on behalf of the public. The Swami repliedin a beautiful speech, which concluded with a feeling referenceto the role played by the Raja in sending him to Chicago.1179The reader may remember that at one time, viz., whenefforts were being made by Swamiji\u2019s Madrasi disciples to raisea fund for sending him to America, the attitude of the Raja ofRamnad, rightly or wrongly, had appeared to some to be ratherequivocal. We have no definite evidences which may enableus to come to a conclusion, either way, on the subject. In anycase, the Swami\u2019s eulogistic references to the Raja and thewarmth of feeling displayed by the Raja when he extended hiswelcome to the Swami on his return to India indicate that, ifever there had been a hitch, the Swami was too generous toremember it and the Raja more than made amends for it. 23 Togo back to the story of the Swami\u2019s reception at Pamban, afterthe Swami\u2019s speech he was taken in a grand procession to theRaj bungalow where he was to stay till he started for Ramnad(Ramanathapuram). During the journey to the bungalow, theRaja showed the Swami the highest courtesy and respect byputting him on the state carriage, while he with his officialswalked alongside of it, and after a little time even unharnessedthe horses and drew it through the town. Next day, 27 January1897, when the Swami visited the temple of Rameswar, specialhonours, such as the Hindus pay only to their mahatmas , wereshown him. Near about the temple a procession which includedelephants, camels, horses, the temple insignia, Indianmusicians, etc., was waiting to escort him to it. His disciples(including the Europeans?) were conducted through thebuilding and shown its many architectural wonders, particularlythe galleries supported by a thousand pillars, and the templejewels were displayed before them. Did the memory of the dayfleet across the Swami\u2019s mind when, four years ago, he hadfirst visited this same temple, footsore and hungry, and nonewho chanced to see him thought any more about him than oneusually does about thousands of other pilgrims who visit thegreat temple every day?AT PAMBAN, RAMESWAR, RAMNADSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1180We do not know, but one may feel sure that, if he didremember that day the thought of it hardly made for anydifference in the substance of his prayer on this day of histriumph to the Lord of the temple. That day an old vow hadbeen fulfilled and there had come a new, or a renewed vow, ora dedication \u2014 to Him who was not in image alone, but in theUniverse, in the poor, the weak the diseased. Standing on thetemple grounds again after four years \u2014 in a position differentfrom the obscure monk that he was four years ago \u2014 as theGreat Teacher, every word that fell from whose lips, thousandslistened to with respect, he spoke of the God who dwelt in Hiscreatures, high and low, saint and sinner, and called on themall to serve Him. The Raja of Ramnad immediately responded\u2014 he arranged for the feeding of and distribution of clothingto thousands of poor people. This was actually done onThursday, 28 January 1897 at Ramnad after the Swami arrivedthere. 24 The Raja also ordered that a  tower, forty feet high,was to be erected where the Swami first put his sacred foot onthe soil of his territory. The tower was to bear the followinginscription: \u201cSatyameva Jayate. The monument erected byBhaskara Sethupathi, the Raja of Ramnad marks the sacredspot, where his Holiness Swami Vivekananda\u2019s blessed feetfirst trod on Indian soil, together with the Swami\u2019s Englishdisciples, on His Holiness\u2019s return from the WesternHemisphere, where glorious and unprecedented successattended His Holiness\u2019s philanthropic labours to spread thereligion of the Vedanta. January 27, 1897.\u201d 25At 4 a.m. on Friday, 29 January, the Swami with his partyleft for Ramnad in a boat belonging to the Raja, reaching it inthe evening. In the midst of tumultuous rejoicing and festivity,he was received by the Raja on the bank of a lake and thentaken to Sankara Villa, the place where he was to reside, in a1181grand procession, seated in the statecarriage while the Rajawalked on foot. When half the distance had been traversed, atthe request of the Raja, he got into a handsome state palanquinand, after resting at the Villa for a little while, was taken to theDurbar Hall, where thousands were gathered, expecting thathe would make a speech. The address of welcome was prefacedby a speech from the Raja and, after being read out by hisbrother, Raja Dinkar Sethupathi, was presented to him in amassive casket of solid gold. The Swami made a speech, whichwas characterized by beauty of thought and inspiring eloquence.To commemorate the sacred occasion of the Swami\u2019s visit, theRaja announced the opening by public subscription of a fundfor the relief of famine in Madras. On the following day theSwami delivered a lecture at the Christian Missionary Schooland attended a Durbar held in his honour in the palace. At thismeeting he conferred on the Raja the title of \u201cRajarshi\u201d,signifying that the Raja was both a ruler and a sage in one. Atthe request  of the Raja, he gave a short address into aphonograph on the need of Sakti worship in India.IIIA Fortnight had now passed after Swami Vivekananda hadlanded at Colombo, expecting that he would soon visit Madrasand Calcutta and begin his work. There was no sign yet whenhe left that the longing of the people for a sight of him and forhearing him, first expressed in the tumultuous reception givento him on the sea beach at Colombo, had in any way diminished.Invitations had already been pouring in from every place thatfell on the way to Madras, requesting him to halt at them for aday or two, or even less. The strain he had been put to hadalready begun to tell on him, \u2014 even Swamis having bodieswhich were subject to the laws of matter, as he gently remindedON HIS WAY TO MADRASSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1182his admirers at Manamadura, Madura, and other places. Yet,occasionally, he had to yield to their \u201cimportunities\u201d, as weshall see presently. The journey to Madras, which is about380 miles by rail from Ramnad, is arduous enough and becamefar more so for the Swami for a number of reasons. Firstly, hehad to halt at a number of places on his way to Madras, whichmeant going through crowded programmes at each of them,besides having sleepless nights, \u2014 for the journeys were doneat night and, for some distances, by coach. Even when thejourneys were done by rail, as they were done from Maduraonwards, he did not have a wink of sleep at night, for at everystation at which his train halted, thousands were found to havegathered on the platforms. They came with presents andaddresses of welcome and requested him to pay them a visit.At Trichinopoly (Tiruchchirappali), for example, at 4 o\u2019clockin the morning, and at Tanjore (Thanjavur) a little later peoplegathered in their thousands to do so. At a small station nearMadras, where the train did not halt, it was made to do so bycrowds who, after  their requests to the stationmaster to makeit halt for a while had failed, fell flat on the railway lines at riskof their lives. A catastrophe was averted by the presence ofmind of the guard of the train who stopped the train in the nickof time.Speaking about the strain that Swami Vivekananda wasput to ever since he landed in Colombo, Romain Rolland hascommented as follows, \u201cA sick man who needed to nurse hisvitality, he made a superhuman expenditure of energy.\u201d Whilethis is quite correct, one wonders wherefrom came all thisenergy that enabled him to cope with the demands that wereincessantly made on his body and mind all these days. Anexplanation may perhaps be found in the fact that, being akarmayogin (as spoken of in the Gita), he worked without1183attachment to the fruits of action and so in freedom. In hisnotes on verses v and xxv of Chapter III of the Bhagavad-Gita, Dr. Radhakrishnan describes such a person as follows: \u201cHeworks as God works, without any binding necessity orcompelling ignorance, and even in performing work, he is notinvolved. When his egoism is removed, action springs fromthe depths and is governed by the Supreme secretly seated inhis heart. Free from desire and attachment, one with all beings,he acts out of the profoundest depths of his inner being,governed by his immortal, divine, and highest self.\u201d 26 \u201cThoughthe soul which is centred in the light has nothing further toaccomplish for itself, it unites itself with the cosmic action,even as the Divine does. Its activity will be inspired by thelight and joy of the Supreme,\u201d 27 Even such a soul, one mayobserve, is encased in a body, which, as Swami Vivekanandatold his admirers many a time, is governed by the laws of matterand is subject to fatigue, illness, decay and death. Unmindfulof the fact, however, he worked unceasingly in the service ofhis fellowmen, expending all the energy that the exceptionallysturdy body that nature had endowed him  with, possessed,doing so cheerfully and deliberately till the end. As he wrote toSwami Akhandananda once, \u201cThe Gerua robe is not forenjoyment. It is the banner of heroic work. You must give yourbody, mind and speech to `the welfare of the world\u2019(jagaddhitaya).\u201d 28 Asked by Prof. Sundararama Iyer how hefound the strength and stamina for such incessant activity ashad been his since his landing in Colombo, Swami Vivekanandareplied, \u201cSpiritual work never tires in India.\u201d 29Leaving Ramnad round about midnight, SwamiVivekananda reached Paramakkudi (23 miles away) in the earlyhours of 1 February 1897. The journey, which was done in acoach by road, like similar journeys earlier in Ceylon, did notAT PARAMAKUDI, MANAMADURAISWAMI VIVEKANANDA1184permit a wink of sleep \u2014 the only redeeming feature beingthat at this time in Southern India, nights are cool and best fortravelling. (This part of our country never has a biting coldseason, which continues in many parts of Northern India tillFebruary. As the wits have it, Southern India has only oneseason, instead of the usual six, viz., summer \u2014 in threedegrees, hot, hotter and hottest.) Be that as it may, the citizensof Paramakkudi gave the Swami a grand reception, whichincluded the presentation of an address. The Swami replied ina fairly long speech which contained many weighty statements,such as the one in which he described the precarious positionin which European civilization was placed at the present time.The political systems of Europe, said Swami Vivekananda, hadbeen tried for centuries, and found wanting. \u201cThe Westernworld,\u201d said he, \u201cis governed by a few Shylocks. All thosethings that you hear about \u2014 constitutional government,freedom, liberty, and parliaments \u2014 are but jokes.\u201d \u201cThe wholeof Western civilization,\u201d he predicted, \u201cwill crumble to piecesin the next fifty years if there is no spiritual foundation. . . .And what will save Europe is the religion of the Upanishads.\u201dIf Europe was groaning under the tyranny of the Shylocks, theEast was groaning under the tyranny of the priests, said he,and he declared that \u201ceach must keep the other in check.\u201dThe Swami could not stay for more than a few hours atParamakkudi, for he was due to arrive and address a meetingat Manamadurai (about fifteen miles away) the same evening.The people of that place and of neighbouring Sivaganga werewiring to him again and again, requesting him to visitManamadurai, even if he could do so for only a few hours andhe had to yield to their \u201cimportunities\u201d. They were filled withjoy when, as they said in their welcome address, the mountaindid come to Mahomet, after once withdrawing its assent to1185come. Thanking them for the warmth of their welcome, theSwami began with saying that just then he was not in a conditionto make a very big speech, for he had \u201ca body after all, foolishthough it may be,\u201d which was subject to the laws of matter andas such had such things as fatigue, etc. Alluding to the fact,mentioned in the address, that European materialism hadswamped India, he said that the fault lay with us. Why have afifth of the population become Muhammadans? asked he. Thefault lay with us \u2014 we did nothing to help them, we neglectedtheir education, both spiritual and secular. This should beattended to, said he, instead of grown men spending their livesin discussing whether water should be drunk with the righthand or the left hand, and so forth. \u201cThere is a danger,\u201d hewent on to say, \u201cof our religion getting into the kitchen. We areneither Vedantists, most of us now, nor Pauranics, nor Tantrics.We are just `Don\u2019t touchists.\u2019 Our religion is the kitchen. OurGod is the cooking pot, and our religion is `Don\u2019t touch me, Iam holy.\u2019 If this goes on for another century, every one of uswill be in a lunatic asylum.\u201d 30 One wonders at the boldness ofSwami Vivekananda in denouncing Hindu orthodoxy in suchstrong language before an audience in South India \u2014 the veryhome of the orthodoxy \u2013 and also how the latter took it. Butthey indicate that he was in dead earnest and prepared to faceany opposition.The Swami and party seem to have spent the night inManamadurai and left for Madura (Madurai), possibly by train,on the following morning. They reached the latter place, whichwas thirty miles away, at 10.30 a.m. and were received by thepublic \u201cwith temple stalangam .\u201d 31 They stayed at RamnadKothi, where there was the usual stream of visitors, includinga party of learned gentlemen, who asked him a number ofquestions on Hindu philosophy, e.g., his position on Maya, theAT MADURAISWAMI VIVEKANANDA1186claim that the Vedas are eternal, the nature of Mukti accordingto Vedanta and also the Buddhists, etc. A report of this interviewwhich should not be confused with another report of aninterview which a representative of The Hindu had with himwhile travelling with him in his train between Chengalpattuand Madras, 32 was published in The Hindu a few days laterand reproduced in The Indian Mirror on 18 February. Judgingfrom the length of the report, the \u201cdiscourse\u201d lasted a prettylong time, and ended only when the time that had beenappointed for the Swami to pay a visit to the Minakshi Devitemple arrived. This temple, the pride of Madura, is said tohave been built in the middle of the sixteenth century in thereign of Vishwanath, the first ruler of the Nayak dynasty. Itforms a parallelogram, and is surrounded by nine elaboratelycarved and coloured gopuras , of which the largest is 152 feethigh. It also contains a \u201chall of thousand pillars\u201d and some ofthe finest carving in Southern India. The Swami was receivedwith marked respect by the temple priests, with whom heconversed very cordially and who showed him the treasurescollected in the temple, which included a rare gajamoti(elephant pearl).The Swami drove from the temple to the Native College,where the formal ceremony of reception was gone through. At5 p.m. the College and its compound were already denselypacked. After the address of welcome was read, the Swamidelivered a fairly long speech, even though, as he said, he hadbeen continually travelling and speaking during the last threeweeks and \u201cunfortunately, even Swamis have bodies.\u201d Hereserved a fuller and longer speech for a future occasion (which,alas, never came). He declared that the Raja of Ramnad hadput the idea of the visit to Chicago into his head. Continuing,he said that it has been the destiny of India in the past to supply1187spirituality to the world and that at the present time, whileWestern ideas of organization and external civilization werepouring into India, Indian spirituality was \u201cdeluging\u201d the West.The highest goal, he went on to say, was not conflict but theharmony of nations. Referring to the great revival of religionthat had taken place in India, he asked his countrymen to avoidthe Scylla of the old superstitious orthodoxy and the Charybdisof Western materialism. If India was to be completelyEuropeanized, the Swami said, she would die as a nation. Hedid not mean, however, that every superstition of every villageshould be supported. Distinguish the permanent in Hinduismfrom the accidental, said he. He said that our sastras deal withtwo sorts of truth \u2014 one that is eternal and is chiefly embodiedin the Vedas and the other which is the expression of localcircumstances and is embodied in the Smritis, Puranas, etc. Itwas a mistake to think, said the Swami, that if a little socialcustom was going to be changed, religion was going to be lost.Customs had undergone changes \u2014 for example, there was atime in our country when, without eating beef, no Brahmincould remain a Brahmin. The killing of cows was given upbecause it entailed loss agriculturally. The Swami concludedby saying that in early society, the leaders  were not kings, orgenerals, but Rishis. He exhorted his audience to realize theideal of a Rishi.Swami Vivekananda and party left Madura the same nightby train for Kumbakonam, which was 150 miles away, at about10.30 p.m. In anticipation of heavy work to do done at Madras,it was decided that he should have some rest before he arrivedthere. The people of Kumbakonam, who were great admirersof the Swami and had on Wednesday, 22 August 1894, as wehave said above, with Diwan Bhadur Raghunath Rao in thechair and Rai Bahadur S. S. Seshayya, C.S.I. 33 among theAT KUMBAKONAMSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1188speakers, held a meeting, congratulating him on his success inthe Chicago Parliament (a fortnight before Calcutta citizensdid it) were also most anxious that he should stay with themfor a few days. Even though the Swami was hard pressed fortime, it was, therefore, decided that he should halt atKumbakonam for three days. As we have said above, at everystation where his train stopped, thousands were found gatheredon the platforms with presents and welcome addresses. At about4 o\u2019clock in the morning at Trichinopoly (Tiruchchirappali),where the train stopped for 25 minutes, an address was readout on behalf of the citizens, thanking him for having madeHinduism praised \u201cin every nook and corner of the mightyBritish Empire\u201d and offering him their sincerest respects. Theyregretted that it was not possible for him to stay with themeven for a day, though, as they said, they were consoled at thethought that what was their loss was Madras\u2019s gain. A littlelater, when the train stopped at Tanjore (Thanjavur) there wasa similar demonstration. In every case, the Swami lovinglyacknowledged these expressions of love and respect of hisfellowcountrymen and replied most suitably to their addresses.It may be mentioned here that even after the Swami had reachedKumbakonam, the students of Trichinopoly sent a deputationto him with a memorial signed by 750 students  requestinghim to cut short his stay at Kumbakonam by a day and give itto them. The deputation met the Swami in the \u201cNilgiri Hall\u201d at9 a.m., probably on 5 February 1897, and was headed by MessrsK.S. Krishnamachari and S.M. Raja Ram. The Swami regrettedthat time effectually prevented his paying even a short visit totheir city at present, and promised that he would not fail toinclude it in his programme in the autumn when he proposedto make a lecture tour throughout Southern India. 341189The Swami received the usual spontaneous and imposingreception of his countrymen at Kumbakonam, a city which hasinteresting historical and religious associations. It was thecapital of the Chola race, an old Hindu dynasty, from whomthe whole coast of Coromandal, or Chormandal, derives itsname. It has a gopuram , or gate minar rising to a height of 100feet, and ornamented with stucco figures. One of its water tanksis traditionally connected with the Ganga by a subterraneanpassage and so forms a centre for pilgrims. We have no detailedinformation as to how the Swami passed his three days atKumbakonam, but there were a stream of visitors and frequentdiscussions and he visited the temples and sites of works ofarchitectural and historical interest. He exchanged visits withDewan Seshayya Sastri, C.S.I., Dewan Raghunath Rao andothers.35 Two addresses of welcome were presented to him atthe Porter Town Hall, which had a record gathering, one fromthe citizens at large and the other from the student community.In reply to the former Swami Vivekananda delivered one ofthe most stirring addresses of his whole tour, \u201cThe Mission ofthe Vedanta\u201d. It is not possible for us to give even a baresummary of this speech which lasted several hours, and wemust confine ourselves to mentioning just a few of the leadingideas. Referring to the charge that our religion does not bringgold to us and so is not worthy of acceptance, he said that itwas exactly for that reason \u2014 the reason that it did not consider\u201cthis little sense world of three days\u2019 duration\u201d as the be alland end all of life \u2014 that it was the only true religion and onethat could become the universal religion of man. He said that asense of world-weariness had come upon the Western worldand that some of the best thinkers there were feeling that whatmight save it was not just a few social and political reformsbut a change of the soul itself for the better. He said that hewas not a mere social reformer and that he thought that littleAT MAYAVARAM, CHENGALPATTUSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1190good would come out of the reform movements that wereprevailing in our country at the present day, since they werejust \u201cinconsiderate imitations of western means and methodsof work.\u201d Good results, said he, could be produced only throughlove, through sympathy.Swami Vivekananda said that in ancient times the idealman was the Brahmin, in whom worldliness was altogetherabsent and true wisdom was abundantly present. The solutionof the present-day caste system, said he, did not lie in degradingthose who were already high up, but by \u201cevery one of usfulfilling the dictates of our Vedantic religion, by our attainingspirituality, and by our becoming the ideal Brahmin.\u201d ThisVedantic ideal, he went on to say, was applicable not only herebut over the whole world. This \u201cship of our nation\u201d, he remindedhis listeners, has been plying for ages. \u201cToday, perhaps, it hassprung a leak; today, perhaps, it has become a little worn out.And if such is the case, it behoves you and me to try our best tostop the leak and the holes. Let us tell our countrymen of thedanger, let them awake and help us.\u201d He called upon them tocarry the light and the life of the Vedanta to every door androuse up the divinity that is hidden within every soul. \u201cO yemodern Hindus, dehypnotise yourselves. . . . Teach yourselves,teach everyone his real nature, call upon the sleeping soul andsee how it awakes,\u201d said he. We have had weeping enough, hedeclared, nor is this,  he said, the time for softness. \u201cWhat ourcountry now wants are muscles of iron and nerves of steel,gigantic wills which nothing can resist, which can penetrateinto the mysteries and secrets of the universe and willaccomplish their purpose in any fashion, even if it meant goingdown to the bottom of the ocean, and meeting death face toface.\u201d That was his call to his countrymen. 361191Swami Vivekananda left Kumbakonam for Madras(a distance of 194 miles) by a mail train at about 10.45 p.m. on5 February 1897. He was accompanied by his gurubhais, SwamiNiranjanananda and Swami Sivananda, and Mr. Goodwin, \u2014Captain and Mrs. Sevier having already left for Madras a dayearlier. At every station where the train stopped, there was theusual rush of people eager to have a sight of him and pay theirrespects to him. At Mayavaram (Mayuram) which was 20 milesfrom Kumbakonam and where the train arrived at about 11.30p.m. and halted for about 10 minutes, there was a large gatheringon the platform. Mr C. Venkata Row Sahib, the District Munsiffof the place, garlanded the Swami and an address was read outby Mr. D. Natesa Aiyar. Swami Vivekananda said that he hadnot done anything great and that anybody else would do better.Yet, said he, he was pleased to see that even his small labourhad been appreciated. He had a short conversation with theMunsiff and promised that he would visit Mayavaram onanother occasion. The train moved in the midst of great cheersand enthusiasm.37At Chengalpattu station which was 35 miles from Madrasand where the train arrived at about 6.a.m. of 6 February 1897,a representative of The Madras Mail got into his compartmentand had an \u201cinterview\u201d with him while travelling with him toMadras. A number of questions were put to the Swami byProf. Rangacharya whom, as we have seen, he had met duringhis stay at Prof. Sundararama Iyer\u2019s place at Trivandrum andwho, at the time posted at Kumbakonam, was a fellowpassenger in his compartment. The representative of TheMadras Mail did little more than take down the Swami\u2019s repliesin shorthand and made a report which was published in hispaper in the evening of the same day. 38 A representative of TheHindu who had also got into the compartment at ChengalpattuAT MAYAVARAM, CHENGALPATTUSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1192prepared a report of his \u201cinterview,\u201d which was published inhis paper. It appears that both reporters simultaneously tookdown in shorthand Swamiji\u2019s replies to some questions whichhad been framed by Prof. Rangacharya, who was travelling inthe same compartment with Swamiji from Kumbakonam. Thereports, which are almost identical, raised a controversy, whichlasted long. Two statements, in particular, which were allegedlymade by the Swami, in the course of the interview or interviews,gave a handle to his detractors: (1) his statement that heexpected a vast majority of Englishmen to be Vedantins withinthe next ten years and (2) his criticisms of the priests and the\u201cchurchwomen\u201d or \u201cchurchies\u201d of America, who were \u201coldmaids\u201d and were under the thumb of the priests. With theexception of these, the Americans were a very good peopleand loved him much, he said. 39IVLong before Swami Vivekananda arrived at Madras, grandpreparations were being made by the Hindu public to give hima suitable reception. The people were daily reading about thewelcome extended to him, ever since he had landed in Colombo,in every place where he had halted, and about the preparationsthat were being made in other places where he was due to arrive.\u201cEven Calcutta,\u201d so wrote The Hindu , 2 February 1897, \u201cwhichhas of late betrayed peculiar blindness to the claims of its owngreat men, is making preparations to receive this great Hindusage,\u201d 40 It was Madras that had first recognized the Swami\u2019sgreatness and had equipped him for the journey to Chicago.He had represented the Hindus of Madras at the Parliament(so at least they claimed), and was \u201ctheir own Swami\u201d comingback to them. The Hindu wrote that he might stay with themfor about a month, but some others expected that he would1193\u201cremain in Madras and open a centre\u201d there. 41 (It was indeference to this sentiment that, when the Swami later learntabout it, he promised to send them one of his gurubhais who,according to him, best represented him for the purpose andwould remain with them. He sent Swami Ramakrishnananda.)These calculations only added greater zest to their resolve tooutrival all demonstrations of welcome that had been so fargiven to the Swami, or to anything done in the past to receiveany great man \u2014 ruler, or administrator, or conquering hero.The patriotic instincts of the people had been stirred at thethought of what the Swami had done to spread the spiritualmessage of Vedanta to the materialistic West, thereby makingtheir once great and now fallen beloved motherland respectedall over the world. The welcome given to the Swami at Madraswas, however, essentially a spontaneous outburst of joy forparticipating in the homecoming of \u201ctheir own Swami,\u201d anexpression of their gratefulness for all the pains he had takenin his three years\u2019 stay in foreign lands for their common cause.It was, above all, a tribute of respect that instinctively comesout of the human heart for purity and saintliness, for one who,though of mortal frame, had been elevated to near divinity. Weare not surprised to learn that, as at Colombo, the word hadgone round among the common people that he was an avatarof Sambandha Moorthy, that they brought him presents offlowers and coconuts in the spirit in which they did it whenvisiting temples, that women even of high families did thearatrika (waving of lamps) and other ceremonies onapproaching him as they did before deities in the temples,  andthat wherever he went people prostrated themselves (insashtanga pranipata ) en masse before him.As early as 21 December 1896 a preliminary meeting ofthose interested in the work of Swami Vivekananda (AlasingaMADRAS PREPARES TO RECEIVE SWAMIJISWAMI VIVEKANANDA1194above all) had been held at the Castle Kernan (about whichmore below) to concert measures to organize a fitting receptionto him on his return to Madras. A letter received from the Swamiby Dr. Nanjunda Row informing him that he would reachColombo on 14 January 1897 was placed before the meeting,where feeling references to the Swami\u2019s hard and prolongedlabours in the West were made by a number of speakers. 42 AReception Committee was then formed, consisting of somepersons of the highest standing in the Hindu community ofMadras, with the Hon\u2019ble Justice Subrahmanya Iyer as theChairman and including, it is interesting to note, Col. Olcottand Dr. Barrows (who, as we have seen, had come over to Indiato deliver a course of lectures on Christianity). The Committeeprepared two or three leaflets which gave some account of theSwami\u2019s work in the West and comments thereon of some ofthe leading American journals, and which were widelydistributed in the city. They arranged for the construction oftriumphal arches from the Egmore railway station to the KernanCastle and for sticking placards regarding the Swami\u2019s arrivalin all parts of the city. It was decided that during the days of hisstay, the Swami would reside in the Kernan Castle, a beautiful,splendid building just on the beach, commanding a grand viewof the sea. It had four floors, one of which was to be occupiedby the Swami with all its six side rooms, also a beautifullyfurnished hall in the centre and a veranda on the seaside. Thebuilding, which was previously known as the Ice House, hadbeen purchased by M. Biligri Iyengar, a Solicitor, who hadconsecrated his whole estate in support of poor students andwidows. Over an open space in front of the  building, a pandalwas erected, where the Swami was to hold conversations withhis visitors. (It is interesting again to note that Col. Olcott hadoffered to place at the disposal of the Swami a bungalow forhimself and the Convention Hall for his receptions.) 43 In the1195meanwhile there was an influx into the city of many personsfrom the mofussil , while lots of young men who had comethere for their University examinations stayed on \u2014 all eagerto have a glimpse of the Swami. The Hindu published a leaderextolling the Swami\u2019s work in the West. For days, the firstquestion that was asked by a man in the city meeting anotherwas, \u201cWhen is Swami Vivekananda arriving?\u201dOn the morning of 6 February 1897, the date on whichSwami Vivekananda was due to arrive at Madras, thousandshad gathered on the platform of the Egmore railway station,where he was to alight, long before the hour of the arrival ofthe train. The station platform had a festive appearance, beingtastefully decorated with palms and foliage and a profusion offlags and bannerettes. Though admission to the platform wasrestricted only to holders of tickets, it was filled to overflowing.As the train steamed in, exactly at 7.30 a.m. (according to adifferent account, at 7.50 a.m.), a native band struck up a livelynote. As the train came to a standstill and the Swami alightedfrom his compartment on the platform, which was covered withred baize, he was greeted with showers of rosewater and flowersand an outburst of hearty cheers intermingled with cries of\u201cJai Jai Vivekananda\u201d from the teeming thousands. Along withthe Swami were two of his gurubhais, Swamis Niranjananandaand Sivananda, 44 and Mr. Goodwin who, to the surprise of all,was \u201cclothed in purely Indian and Brahmin costume.\u201d Themembers of the Reception Committee, headed by Mr. JusticeSubrahmanya Iyer, stepped forward and welcomed the Swami.Mr. Iyer garlanded  him with a superb jasmine wreath andconducted him with the greatest difficulty through the densecrowd to his carriage. Prof. Iyer, who had managed to elbowhis way to the Swami\u2019s presence, made a sashtanga namaskaraat his feet, and asked him whether he remembered him. HeMADRAS PREPARES TO RECEIVE SWAMIJISWAMI VIVEKANANDA1196replied he never forgot a face and referred to his stay at hishouse at Trivandrum. After the Swami got into the carriagealong with his gurubhais and Mr. Iyer, an address was read.The enthusiasm displayed by the thousands outside the platformon beholding the Swami attired in his picturesque saffron gownand orange coloured turban knew no bounds.The carriage of the Swami drawn by two gailycaparisoned white horses and followed by a long train ofcarriages moved slowly as, in spite of the fact that severalhundreds of policemen headed by Mr. H. M. Upshon,Superintendent of City Police, were posted on special duty,denser and denser crowds surged near to the wheels. It had tostop repeatedly to enable people to offer addresses of welcome,fruits, flowers, betel leaves, etc., the Swami reserving his repliestill the day when the formal reception ceremony was to beheld. There was a perpetual shower of flowers at every pointof the route to Castle Kernan and under the triumphal arches,seventeen of which had been constructed and bore inscriptionssuch as, \u201cAwakened India\u2019s Hearty Greetings to SwamiVivekananda!\u201d \u201cHail Harbinger of Peace!\u201d \u201cHail, ShriRamakrishna\u2019s Worthy Son!\u201d \u201cWelcome, Prince of Men!\u201d \u201cEkam Sad Vipra Bahudha Vadanti !\u201d etc. The procession haltedfor five minutes at a spacious shamiana that had been put up infront of the Andhraprakasika office and where a welcomeaddress was presented in the name of the Telugu speakinginhabitants of the city. It being holy Vasantha Panchami daywhich is dedicated to Manmatha or Madana who, according tothe Puranas, entering into all beings, enamours  one and all,reference was made in the address to the Swami\u2019s resemblance,in a special sense, to the god. \u201cMadana\u2019s conquest,\u201d it wassaid in the address, \u201cis with the aid of his arrow; while that ofYour Holiness is with the divine afflatus of an orator, the magic1197of your voice and oratory \u2014 and with this Your Holiness hasconquered the hearts of many in the Western World, and enlistednot only their sympathetic adoration and admiration but alsosincere love and homage \u2014 a result quite unparalleled in thehistories of the Founders of the three great systems of HinduPhilosophy.\u201d The Swami again halted at the City Stables, wherehe was presented with a Devanagari address of welcome. Whenthe procession moved to the southern gate of Chepauk, it wasjoined by a sankirtan party and when it passed through thesplendid arch put up by Raja Eswara Doss Bahadur, a bandstruck up and kept playing till it reached Castle Kernan. Onthe procession reaching South Beach Road, a large number ofpeople, mostly students, unharnessed the horses,notwithstanding the expressed regret of the Swami, and drewthe carriage till Castle Kernan was reached. It was not till halfpast nine that the place was reached.At the Castle Kernan, which was gaily decorated withflags and streamers, every arrangement that had been made forthe comfort and convenience of the Swami was successfullycarried out. The Swami and his party were conducted to thecharmingly decorated and refreshingly cool pandal that had,as we have seen, been put up for the occasion and led to theirrespective seats on the dais. Two addresses were then read out,one in Sanskrit and the other in Canarese \u2014 the former beingfrom the Vidvanmanoranjani Sabha, an institution set up inMadras for enacting dramas by Kalidasa and others in Sanskrit,English, Tamil and Telugu. In their address, the Sabha, afteracquainting the Swami with their purpose, invited him to attendthe performance of the Probodha Chandrodaya by themselvesat the Victoria Public Hall in honour of the Swami. Thegathering then dispersed, at the suggestion of Mr. Iyer, to enablethe Swami to have rest. The Swami now met some of hisA GRAND RECEPTIONSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1198Colombo, January, 18971199Chennai, January, 1897SWAMI VIVEKANANDA1200gurubhais and entered into close and familiar intercourse withthem. Their simple ways, easy manners and unconventionalbehaviour towards each other were delightful to witness. TheSwami had his meals with them and then came up to the hallin the upper storey with a view to having some rest but it wasonly for a brief while that he could be alone. Presently,Professors Sundararama Iyer and Rangacharya, who had beeninvited by Alasinga to interview the Swami to draw up hislecture programme during his sojourn at Madras, came in. Theyhad to settle the matter at once because Prof. Rangacharya wasleaving for Kumbakonam the next day. The Swami asked themto settle the topics between themselves and inform him. Theyfixed the topics as follows: (1) My Plan of Campaign, (2) TheSages of India, (3) Vedanta in its Relation to Practical Life,and (4) The Future of India. At Alasinga\u2019s request, the Swamihad already promised to visit the Triplicane Literary Societyand deliver an address there on \u201cSome Aspects of his Work inIndia.\u201d The programme was actually carried out in entirety.Besides, every morning and evening, he sat at the pandal andanswered all questions put to him by all and sundry. The sameevening, or perhaps the next day\u2019s forenoon, says Prof. Iyer, atthe request of himself and Prof. Rangacharya for a little of hismusic, about which they had heard so much, the Swami sangone of Jayadeva\u2019s songs in a most entrancing voice and in theappropriate raga (tune) which they had never heard before intheir part of the country.On the following morning (7 February 1897), about twohundred persons were assembled in the pandal to question theSwami on various topics. Some asked him to explain thedifference  between mind and matter, some wished to knowwhether God had a human shape, and so on. SwamiVivekananda replied to all the questions with patience and1201courtesy. The questions and answers came to an end at about 9a.m. but were resumed in the evening, when an acrostic poemin Sanskrit in honour of the Swami was also read out. Someone set the ball rolling by asking the Swami the differencebetween karma and fatalism . The Swami said that karmareferred to that which was the result of one\u2019s doing, fatalismpresupposed some external will, or force operating on us. Againwhile karma implies the power and ability to undo the past,fatalism negatived the possibility of any such power existing,or capable of being exercised. The discussions became verylively when one among the visitors, Prof. P. Lakshmi Narasu,who was an avowed Buddhist and leading contributor to TheAwakener of India , a journal that had been started by his friend,Mr. N. K. Ramaswami Iyer, as a sort of challenge to the claimsof The Awakened India ( Prabuddha Bharata ), insisted onhaving a free talk on Vedanta to which, they said, they hadstrong objections. (Mr. Ramaswami Iyer was of opinion thatSwami Vivekananda\u2019s labours in America and the propagandawork done by his disciples in Madras had not awakened Indiaas the title \u201c Awakened India \u201c suggested. He claimed that hisown paper, \u201c The Awakener of India \u201c was doing so.) 45 Duringthe interview, Mr. Narasu heckled the Swami on the essentialtenets of Vedantism and the latter dealt with all his points withadmirable lucidity, force, and aptness. The discussion wasadjourned at about 6.30 p.m. 46Though it had been announced that the Swami would beavailable daily for some hours in the mornings and the eveningsfor discussions, as a matter of fact, at all hours of the day andfar into the night, whenever he was free from outsideengagements, there was a rush of visitors at the Kernan Castle.Women, often  of high families, came daily to worship at hisfeet and receive his blessings. One day, a young man who hadTHE SWAMI  AT KERNAN CASTLESWAMI VIVEKANANDA1202started practising yoga as instructed in the Swami\u2019s treatise,\u201cRaja Yoga\u201d, and had been warned by his friends that insanitymight result from unaided practice, came to narrate hisexperiences to the Swami. The Swami advised him not to listento his friends and to persist in his resolve to reach the goal ofsamadhi. Another day a venerable old man who belonged tothe Vaikhanasa school of Agamas came from Tirupati, fell athis feet, garlanded him with flowers and with tears in his eyesspoke of him as Vikhanasa himself once again. (Vikhanasa wasthe founder of a school that bears his name and is consideredby his followers as an incarnation of Vishnu.) 47 Not all those,however, who sought interviews with him, came to receivelight from him. or with the sincere desire for havingphilosophical discussions with him. Some came to test hisscholarship, or to show off theirs; some were thoroughsectarians who came to dispute with him in the hope of winninghim over to their ways of thinking; and so on. As we haveseen, the experience was nothing new to the Swami, who knewhow to deal with each such person as he merited and in doingso always won the respect of fair-minded opponents, even ifthey did not give in.A number of such events have been authoritativelyrecorded, and we proceed to describe them together, instead ofchronologically, here, since the dates on which they happenedare either not mentioned, or seem to be doubtful. One day adeputation of Saivites, some five or six in number, fromTirupattur (then in the Salem district) came to meet him. Noneof them was a Brahmin, and they seemed to have been preparedand sent on to meet the Swami by Mr. Nallaswami Pillai, theDistrict Munsiff of the place, who was soon to become famousas the organizer of a widespread Saivite movement. The leaderasked  the Swami, \u201cHow does the Unmanifested become the1203manifested?\u201d This question, which had been put to the Swamimany times in the past, even sometimes in America and latestat Madura, was met by the Swami with the same argument hehad advanced everywhere, and it confounded his present as ithad done his past questioners. Coolly the Swami said,\u201cQuestions of how, why, or wherefore relate to the manifestedworld, and not to the Unmanifested which is above all changeand causation and therefore above all relation to the changinguniverse and our samsarika (transmigrating) life in it. Thequestion, therefore, is not reasonably put. Put a proper question\u2014 a more rational question \u2014 and I will answer.\u201d As thequestioners sat speechless \u2014 the Swami\u2019s enchantingpersonality gradually stealing over their minds and hearts \u2014they felt, as if there stood before them a long-lost comrade oftheir youth, or a tenderly beloved brother restored to them aftera long separation. In a captivating voice, the Swami said, \u201cThebest way to serve and seek God is to serve the needy, to feedthe hungry, to console the stricken, to help the fallen andfriendless, to attend and serve those who are ill and requireservice.\u201d The hearts of the men were won and they offeredtheir homage at the feet of the Swami. As they took their leave,their faces showed traces of a new light having touched theirhearts and given them a new impulse to life and work. 48The same question was put to the Swami a few dayslater (according to Prof. Iyer, on the morning of 12 February1897) by a young Madhva student who, receiving the identicalreply, was somewhat confounded and ejaculated, \u201cwhat, Sir?\u201dThere was a murmur of disapproval from the audience at theuse of the term \u201cSir\u201d in addressing the Swami, but the incidentclosed at that point. Perhaps, like the Saivites, he too did notescape totally the \u201cenchantment\u201d of the Swami, for we learnfrom Prof. Iyer that in later life he developed into an ardentTHE SWAMI  AT KERNAN CASTLESWAMI VIVEKANANDA1204and public-spirited citizen of Madras and was one of the mostactive Councilors of the Corporation. A few more incidentsthat we learn about in the records indicate that the Swami wasnot averse to using sledgehammer tactics in debates whichseemed to him to be entirely without purpose. One evening aPandit asked him why he, who was a Sudra and as such,according to the sastras, had no right to take to sannyasa , haddone so. The Swami replied, \u201cI belong to the line of Chitraguptato whom every Brahmin prays during his sandhya worship.So, if Brahmins are entitled to sannyasa , much more so am I.\u201dThen he said, \u201cIn your Sanskrit question there was anunpardonable mispronunciation. Panini denounces suchmispronunciation \u2014 na mlechchhitam vai, napabhashitam vai(one should not degrade, or mispronounce words). So you haveno right to carry on this debate.\u201d The Pandit beat a retreat. 49Prof. Iyer narrates that there was an unusual flow ofvisitors at the Kernan Castle at the Swami\u2019s discussion hoursboth in the morning and the evening of 12 February 1897.Everybody present admired both his dialectical swordplay withthose who wanted little more than attempting to outwit him byscholarship as well as his sympathetic response to honestenquiry. There was a young European lady visitor who engagedhim in a discussion of some knotty questions in Indianphilosophy twice on that day. She was so satisfied with theSwami\u2019s answers in the morning discussion that she came againin the afternoon, accompanied by her father who was engagedin Christian missionary work in Madras, and sought andobtained an interview which lasted an hour. Before taking leaveof the Swami she told him that she would be leaving for Londonin a few days to resume her work in the slums there, andwondered whether they would meet again. The Swami saidthat she might rest assured as to  that, since he intended to go1205back to London after taking some rest and starting theSri Ramakrishna Mission in India. In contrast with thebehaviour of this lady was that of a Vaishnava Pandit, who thatsame evening attempted to force a discussion on the Swamiabout Vedanta, which the Swami refused to do, saying that hecould not waste his time in mere wordy wranglings. The Panditinsisted on speaking in Sanskrit and the Swami replied to himin English. We do not know exactly what were the Pandit\u2019scontentions but it appears that his main object was to force anadmission from the Swami that he was an out-and-out Advaitin(Monist) \u2014 the Vaishnavas being strongly opposed to Advaitatenets, such as Tat Tvam Asi (Thou art That), etc. The Swamifinally disposed of the Pandit by saying, in English, \u201cTell thePandit that as long as I have this body I am a Dvaitin, but notafterwards.\u201d The Pandit then said, in Tamil, \u201cThe Swami\u2019sstatement is really an avowal that he is an Advaitin.\u201d The Swamirejoined, \u201cLet it be so.\u201d The matter then dropped.VAfter it had been known that Monday, 8 February 1897 hadbeen fixed for giving a public reception to Swami Vivekananda,thousands were waiting for the hour \u2014 4.30 p.m. \u2014 of thatday with eager expectation of being able to participate in thathappy ceremony. In the words of Prof. Iyer, \u201cit was a day ofuniversal and high wrought expectation. The interest felt andevinced by the entire educated community and the studentpopulation of Madras had reached heights and summits noteasily imaginable.\u201d The scene in front of the Victoria Hall andalong the roads and byways leading to it defies adequatedefinition, or accurate description. The Swami\u2019s carriage, as itpassed, could not easily find the space it needed for reachingits destination. Long before the Swami arrived at the Hall itTHE SWAMI  AT KERNAN CASTLESWAMI VIVEKANANDA1206was literally packed to overflowing, while a crowd of aboutten thousand persons  was outside. It was as could, or shouldhave been anticipated, but at the moment none was anxious towaste his time over trying to find out on what particular pair ofshoulders the responsibility for the impasse lay. As somebodylater said, using the words of Carlyle for a similar state of affairs,\u201cit was he, it was she, it was it.\u201d The Swami realized thesituation at a glance as with the greatest difficulty he made hisway to the platform. The Hon\u2019ble Sir Bhashyam Iyengar hadalready occupied the chair and among those present were theHon\u2019ble Mr. Justice Subrahmanya Iyer, the Hon\u2019ble Mr. N.Subba Rao Puntulu, the Hon\u2019ble Mr. P. Rajarathna Mudaliar,Col. H. S. Olcott, Mr. M.P. Parthasarathy Iyengar,Prof. Sundararama Iyer, among others. Addresses werepresented to the Swami on behalf of the Madras ReceptionCommittee, the Vaidikavidvat Katha Prasanga Sabha, theMaharaja of Khetri and the Madras Social Reform Association.Twenty other addresses in Sanskrit, English, Tamil and Teluguwere also read and presented to the Swami.Meanwhile, the crowd outside was getting unmanageableand the demand for an open air meeting, which the Swami hadheard even as he was entering the hall, became louder andlouder. The Swami\u2019s heart was touched and he came out of thehall, followed by the audience, intending to address the crowd.It was an impossible task, but he managed to mount to the boxseat of the carriage and pair in which he had been driven, andspoke in \u201cthe Gita fashion,\u201d to use his own way of expressinghimself. (The reference was to Sri Krishna speaking to Arjunaseated in a chariot before the battle of Kurukshetra began. Ifthe Swami\u2019s carriage had a pair of white horses as it has on theday of his arrival at Madras, the resemblance was closer, cp.,tatah svetairhayairyukte mahati syandane sthitau , etc., in the1207Gita, I, 14.) The Swami began his reply to the addresses inmore or  less the same strain in which he had done so in previousplaces, but his voice could not reach any but a few in the vastcrowd. Realizing that it was a hopeless task which he had sethimself to, he finished his speech with the following words,\u201cFriends, I am very much pleased with your enthusiasm. It ismarvellous. . . . This is what is required \u2014 tremendousenthusiasm. Only make it permanent, keep it up. Let not thefire die out. We want to work great things in India. For that Irequire your help; such enthusiasm is necessary. . . . I thankyou for your kindness and enthusiastic welcome. In calmermoments we would have better thoughts and ideas to exchange;now for the time, my friends, goodbye.\u201d The Swami thenproclaimed \u201cVictory\u201d to the name of Aryan Dharma, to thename of his guru, Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, and toBhagavan Sri Krishna. The gathering enthusiasticallyresponded \u201cJai Jai\u201d and dispersed, disappointed at the suddentermination of the Swami\u2019s address owing to the confusionthat prevented it, but immensely satisfied at seeing him andwith an inexpressible and unexplainable joy in their hearts.50On the following day, Tuesday, 9 February 1897, SwamiVivekananda delivered two addresses, one in the morning atthe Triplicane Literary Society on \u201cThe Work Before Us\u201d,51and the second \u2014 his first public address in Madras \u2014 in theafternoon at the Victoria Public Hall on \u201cMy Plan ofCampaign\u201d.52 (The proceedings in both the meetings, or forthat matter, in all his subsequent meetings, were perfectlyorderly \u2014 the admission in the first being restricted to themembers of the society and invited persons and in the othersto ticketholders. The last meeting of the Swami was held inthe Harmston Circus Tent, which admitted a much vasteraudience than the Victoria Public Hall and the amiableTHE WORK BEFORE USSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1208proprietress of which had lent its use on a small rent.) In thewelcome address at the Triplicane  Literary Society, theSwami\u2019s attention was called to the fact that previous to hisdeparture for America his first public appearance was at thehall of the Society, and it was what had enabled the citizens ofMadras to have a true estimate of the worth and weight of theSwami. The Swami, who spoke for over an hour, began withthanking the Society for having afforded him the earliestopportunity to make himself known to the people of Madras.The Swami regretted that the Indian people had lost theoriginality they once possessed, so much so that for hundredsof years they had been discussing such \u201cmomentous problemsas whether one should drink water with the right hand, or theleft, or whether I may touch you or you touch me, and what isthe penance for this touching.\u201d He said that we must give upthe idea that we are the people in the world and that though wehave much to teach others, we must be ready to learn fromanybody who can teach us. We must go out, said the Swami.\u201cThe first manifest effect of life is expansion. You must expandif you want to live. The moment you have ceased to expand,death is upon you, danger is ahead. I went to America andEurope, to which you so kindly allude; I have to, because thatis the first sign of revival of national life, expansion. Thisreviving national life, expanding inside, threw me off, andthousands will be thrown off that way.\u201d Continuing, the Swamisaid that as England, by her tremendous power, was linkingthe different parts of the world together, India was getting readyto give her quota to the progress and civilization of the world.\u201cAnd that I have been forced, as it were, by nature, to go overand preach to America and England, is the result. Every oneought to have seen that the time had arrived.\u201d\u201cOnce more,\u201d declared Swami Vivekananda, \u201cthe worldmust be conquered by India . . . . Spirituality must conquer the1209West. . . . The whole of the western world is on a volcano, whichmay burst tomorrow, go to pieces tomorrow . . . . We must goout, we must conquer the world through our spirituality andphilosophy. There is no other alternative, we must do it, or die.The only condition of national life, of awakened and vigorousnational life, is the conquest of the world by Indian thought.\u201dThe Swami explained that by the conquest of the world byIndian thought he meant the sending out of the life-givingprinciples, not the hundreds of superstitions that the peoplehave been hugging to their breasts for centuries. He pointedout that the Hindu religion required much purification, a regularsystem of weeding out superstitions that disfigured the essenceof the religion. The Scylla of rank materialism and theCharybdis of arrant superstition must be avoided. In a stirringperoration he said that he would rather have a number of atheiststo deal with than these superstitious and frivolous people \u2014for once thought is devoted to the discussions of mere trifles,the vigour and vitality requisite for the more earnest study ofreligion was dissipated. \u201cWhat we want is vigour in the blood,strength in the muscles and nerves of steel, not softening namby-pamby ideals. Avoid all these. Avoid mystery. There is nomystery in religion.\u201d He ended with the exhortation, \u201cStandup and express the divinity within you.\u201d Notwithstanding thatno notice of the Swami\u2019s presence at the Society\u2019s rooms wasannounced a very large crowd had thronged the premises andcheered the Swami.Swami Vivekananda delivered his first public speech inMadras, entitled \u201cMy Plan of Campaign,\u201d at 4.30 p.m. on thesame day (9 February 1897) at the Victoria Public Hall. He didnot say many things here that he had not said previously atother places; the address, as usual, contained a passionatedefence of Hinduism and of Hindu social institutions togetherMY PLAN OF CAMPAIGNSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1210with an avowal of the need of reform. It contained besides, asthe title suggested, a clear statement of the Swami\u2019s positionvis a vis  other movements that were afoot in the country, ofthe line of action he himself proposed to follow, and an appeal,in unsurpassed eloquence, to his countrymen for cooperationin his work for the regeneration of the motherland. For certainfrank statements of his past experiences of persecution sufferedby him at the hands of certain sects, among whom he mentionedthe Theosophists, the Brahmos, and the Christian missionaries,and some allegations he made against some of their leaders,and some remarks he made about the reformers, however, thespeech gave rise to a prolonged controversy which for longfilled the columns of some newspapers in Madras, Bombayand Calcutta. About the hostility showed to him by theabovementioned people and in particular the vile propagandathat had been carried on by them against him when he was inAmerica, we have told our readers something. We have alsoseen that while some of his friends had stood up in his defence,he had personally held aloof, consistently with his principlethat a monk does not defend himself. While he was in the West,he had already learned that the Theosophists were claimingthat they had paved the path for his success there. On returningto India he came to know how this propaganda was confoundinghis friends and from a gurubhai he received documentaryevidence (see below) that proved how bitter was the hatredwith which the Theosophists regarded him. That perhaps wasthe last straw for his patience, and he decided to \u201cbe out oncefor all.\u201d Prof. Iyer and others had counselled silence, on theground that many Theosophists of Madras held him in thehighest regard, but he was \u201cinexorable.\u201dThe speech began with a reference to the claim made bythe Theosophists that they had paved the path for such success1211as he had achieved in America. He placed some facts beforehis audience and asked them to judge whether they bore outthe claim. Firstly, before he set sail for America he had metthe leader of the Theosophical Society and asked him for aletter of introduction. The gentleman (Col. Olcott) asked himwhether he was prepared to join his Society and being told byhim that he could not do so because he did not believe in mostof their doctrines, told him straightaway that he could not doanything for him. Secondly, when, soon after he had reachedAmerica he found himself out of pocket and did not have clothesto save himself from cold and wrote to his friends in Madrasfor help, one of the Theosophists who came to know about hispredicament wrote, \u201cNow the devil is going to die: God blessus all.\u201d (The Swami told Prof. Iyer that the letter was writtento a well-known Buddhistic friend of his in Calcutta, and thathe heard about it from one of his gurubhais on his return toIndia. This letter, says Prof. Iyer, had been handed over to theBelur Math for safe cutsody.) Thirdly, said the Swami, he metsome Theosophists in the Chicago Parliament and wanted totalk and mix with them. They shunned him. (This has beentaken as a reference to Mrs. Annie Besant who, as we haveseen, was a member of the Parliament of Religions.) Fourthly,said the Swami, he had a tremendous work to do and at everyturn the Theosophists cried him down. The Swami paid a tributeto the sincerity of Mrs. Besant and her labours for raising Indiabut, said he, expressing his gratefulness to her was one thing,and \u201cswallowing\u201d everything that was in the Theosophist creedwas another. As regards the Theosophists\u2019 claim of having pavedhis path to success by their work in America, the Swami toldProf. Iyer that they were rather a hindrance. Many leadingAmericans, said he, had a prejudice against the Mahatmiccranks of Theosophy and its peurile trumperies and monstrousfictions, and imagined that his own mission was a kindredMY PLAN OF CAMPAIGNSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1212movement of obscurantism appealing similarly to masscredulity. The Swami had also other reasons for disfavouringthe Theosophist movement in India; as we have seen, he agreedwith Rajnarain Bose that  foreigners should not be allowed toget the leadership in our religion as they already had done inpolitics.In the speech, the Swami also referred to the persistentefforts of the Christian missionaries in America to injure himby spreading the blackest lies about him, to have him ostracizedin the society of his friends, and to starve him out. He alsonarrated how one of his own countrymen (Pratap ChandraMajumdar, as we know) took part against him in this and dideverything to injure him \u201cin an underhand way.\u201d The Swaminext referred to those who called him a Sudra and challengedhis right to take to sannyasa . We need not give here his replyto these accusers, for it was the same as he had given to aPandit who had put him the same question a few days ago atCastle Kernan, as narrated by us above. (A portion of his replyhas also been quoted by us at the end of Chapter 1, which thereader may go over.) Finally, the Swami clarified his positionwith regard to the reform movements that were going on invarious parts of India. He praised the reform societies in Madrasbut warned that if any of them tried to intimidate him to join it,it was mistaken. He said that he was a greater reformer thanany of the reformers. They wanted to reform only little bits, hewanted root and branch reform. They differed in methods, theirswas the method of destruction, his that of construction. He didnot believe in reform, he believed in growth. He did not wantto put himself in the position of God and dictate to our society,\u201cThis way thou shouldst move and not that.\u201d Who darescommand its motion? There are many evils in our society, butso there are in every other society. \u201cHere, the earth is soaked1213with widows\u2019 tears; there, in the West, the air is rent with thesighs of the unmarried.\u201d \u201cThe history of the world teaches usthat wherever there have been fanatical reforms, the only resulthas been that they have defeated their own ends.\u201d He cited theinstance of  the abolition of slavery in America. The slaves,said he, are a hundred times worse off than they were beforethe abolition. \u201cTherefore I cannot join any of these condemningsocieties.\u201d\u201cThe whole problem of social reform, therefore, resolvesitself into this: where are the people? The tyranny of a minorityis the worst tyranny that the world ever sees. A few men whothink that certain things are evil will not make a nation move.Why does not the nation move? First educate the nation, createyour legislative body, and then law will be forthcoming. Firstcreate the power, the sanction from which the law will spring.The kings are gone; where is the new sanction, the new powerof the people? Bring it up.\u201d He pointed out that most of thereforms that have been agitated for during the past centuryhave been ornamental, \u2014 they have touched only the first twocastes and no other. The question of widow marriage wouldnot touch seventy per cent of our women. You must go downto the basis of the thing, the very root of the matter. That isradical reform. Be not in a hurry. People swallow withoutquestioning a lot of things that is said in condemnation ofidolatry. He did so at one time and to pay the penalty of that hehad to learn his lesson sitting at the feet of one who realizedeverything through idols. \u201cIf such Ramakrishnas are producedby idol worship, what will you have \u2014 the reformer\u2019s creed,or any number of idols?\u201d We must look through each other\u2019seyes. \u201cBoys, moustached babies, who never went out of Madras,standing up and wanting to dictate laws to three hundredmillions of people, with thousands of traditions at their back!MY PLAN OF CAMPAIGNSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1214Are you not ashamed? Stand back from such blasphemy, andlearn first your lessons!\u201d He had the greatest love and respectfor the social reformers of Madras, but he would tell them witha brother\u2019s love that their method was not right.He reiterated with added emphasis what he had said fromevery platform since he had landed at Colombo, that everynation, like each individual, has one theme in this life, whichis its centre, the principal note round which every other notecomes to form the harmony. In India it was religion and anyattempt to throw it off and take up another, such as politics, asthe vitality of national life, will result in the extinction of thenation. \u201cLet all your nerves vibrate through the backbone ofyour religion.\u201d With this as the basis, Swami Vivekanandaproceeded to explain, all improvements must be attempted.\u201cBefore flooding India with socialistic or political ideas,\u201d saidhe, \u201cfirst deluge the land with spiritual ideas.\u201d The truthsconfined in our Upanishads and other scriptures must bebrought out from the books and scattered broadcast over theland. Let the people hear first and whoever makes people hearthe great truths in their scriptures cannot make for himself abetter karma today. In this land of charity, said he, let us takeup the energy of the first charity, the diffusion of spiritualknowledge. He was not the first Sannyasi who went to foreignlands to preach. India has made the gift of her spirituality tothe world again and again. \u201cThat I went to America was notmy doing or your doing; but the God of India who is guidingher destiny sent me and will send hundreds of such to all thenations of the world.\u201d Therefore, my friends, my plan is tostart institutions in India, to train our young men as preachersof the truths of our scriptures, in India and outside India. Men,men these are wanted: everything else will be ready, but strong,vigorous, believing young men, sincere to the backbone are1215wanted. A hundred such and the world becomesrevolutionized. . Let them hear of the Atman \u2014 that even thelowest of the low have Atman within, which never dies andnever is born \u2014 of Him whom the sword cannot pierce, northe fire burn, nor the air dry \u2014 immortal, without beginning orend, the all pure, omnipotent, and omnipresent Atman. Let  themhave faith in themselves. . What we want is strength, so believein yourselves. What we want is muscles of iron and nerves ofsteel. We have wept long enough. No more weeping, but standon your feet and be men. It is a man making religion that wewant. It is man making theories that we want. It is man makingeducation all round that we want. . . .\u201dSwami Vivekananda ended this first address of his tothe people of Madras with the following soul stirring, soulelevating, prophetic words, \u201cI believe in patriotism, and I alsohave my own ideal of patriotism. Three things are necessaryfor great achievements. First, feel from the heart. . . . Loveopens the most impossible gates; love is the gate to all thesecrets of the universe. Feel, therefore, my would-be reformers,my would-be patriots! Do you feel? Do you feel that millionsand millions of the descendants of gods and sages have becomenext-door neighbours to brutes? Do you feel that millions arestarving today and millions have been starving for ages? Doyou feel that ignorance has come over the land as a dark cloud?Does it make you restless? Does it make you sleepless? Has itgone into your blood, coursing, through your veins, becomingconsonant with your heartbeats? Has it made you almost mad?Are you seized with that one idea of the misery of ruin, andhave you forgotten all about your name, your fame, your wives,your property, and even your own bodies? Have you done that?That is the first step to become a patriot, the very first step. Idid not go to America, as most of you know, for the ParliamentMY PLAN OF CAMPAIGNSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1216of Religions, but this demon of a feeling was in me and withinmy soul. I travelled twelve years all over India, finding no wayto work for my countrymen and that is why I went to America.Most of you know that, who knew me then. Who cared aboutthe Parliament of Religions? Here was my own  flesh and bloodsinking every day, and who cared for them? This was my firststep.\u201dThe Swami\u2019s speech stirred patriotic souls but, as wehave said above, his criticism of his opponents, specially theTheosophists, gave rise to a prolonged controversy. At the sametime his observations on the reformers led to amisunderstanding which, happily, was short-lived. In a letterto The Indian Mirror dated 7 March 1897, Col. Olcott saidthat he had no recollection about the Swami asking him for aletter of introduction. Supposing that he had done so, addedhe, he could not have been so rude in his reply as the Swamialleged. 53 A correspondent of the same paper from Madrashowever, wrote a letter which was published in it on 19 March,and in which he had a different story to tell. 54 He said that atthe interview between Col. Olcott and the Swami, two EuropeanBuddhists were present, and that one of them thoroughlydisapproved of the Colonel\u2019s attitude. This gentleman, said thecorrespondent, tried to make amends for it by himself givingintroductions to his friends in England. He also said that hehad made a careful enquiry about the letter allegedly writtenby Col. Olcott to a Buddhistic friend of his who had gone toAmerica for the Parliament of Religions and that he was almostconvinced of its existence. The controversy in the press draggedon for some time, and came to a halt as less and less peopletook further interest in it.Some observations of the Swami on social reform suchas on the subject of widow remarriage and his caustic references1217to \u201cmoustached babies\u201d who considered themselves to be \u201ctheeducators of the world\u201d and \u201cthe tyranny of the minority,\u201dcreated a misunderstanding, which as we have said above, wassoon removed. Earlier, in his interview with the representativesof The Madras Mail and The Hindu (see above), the Swamihad stated his views on social reforms with the unequivocalstatement,  \u201cWe stand in need of reform,\u201d and, as we haveseen, among the addresses of welcome presented to the Swamiat the Victoria Public Hall was one from the Madras HinduSocial Reform Association. On 10 February 1897, a day afterthe Swami had delivered his public speech, the Hindu SocialReform Association held an \u201cAt Home\u201d in his honour in theirpremises in Black Town. In the course of some intimateconversations, the members discussed with their honoured guestsuch questions as widow remarriage, etc. They were also highlypleased with the clarifications that he made of some remarksthat he had made earlier about reforms and reformers. Beforehe left, they presented him with a handsome fan as a mementoof his visit to them. 55 Commenting on this meeting betweenthe Swami and the social reformers of Madras, The IndianSocial Reformer of Bombay wrote as follows on 14 February1897, \u201cNo earwig will henceforth be able to mislead us as tothe attitude of the Swami or the Swami of our real attitude. . . .The Swami is entirely with us.\u201d 56We may state here some of the topics on which theSwami\u2019s views were elicited by the reformers. The Swami hadnot disfavoured the social reform work that was going on inMadras and as a matter of fact had praised it, as contrastedwith the work in Bengal. He had said, \u201cIn many cases, and to acertain extent, there is a revival in Bengal, but in Madras, it isnot a revival, it is a growth, a natural growth.\u201d As regards hisstrictures on \u201cboy reformers\u201d and \u201cdestructive method\u201d and\u201ctyranny of the minority,\u201d the reformers were comforted toMY PLAN OF CAMPAIGNSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1218understand that they \u201cwere entirely foreign to the Swami\u2019sinstincts and were but the echoes of a certain class of people\u201dwith whom they need not concern themselves too much. Asregards the Swami\u2019s reference to \u201cmoustached babies,\u201d theysportingly rejoined that if youth was an objection the Swamiwas in the same boat with them. Asked what he meant by\u201cdestructive work,\u201d the  Swami replied, \u201cDon\u2019t pitch intoanybody\u201d but, dotting the i\u2019s and opening the e\u2019s of his words,they read them as follows: \u201cThe safe rule is, do not go out ofyour way to `pitch into\u2019 persons, but when persons will putthemselves in the way of your cause, do not be too tender withthem.\u201d The social reformers were satisfied that as they werenot the government of the land nor even municipal councilors,the words, \u201ctyranny of the minority\u201d could not be used withreference to them. With regard to the Swami\u2019s statement to arepresentative of The Madras Times that \u201cthe faith of a nationis not determined by the number of husbands that their widowsmarry,\u201d it was ascertained that it had been made in protestagainst the artificial and forced lines on which the widowmarriage movement had been conducted by Pandit Vidyasagarand his followers in Bengal. (It was said that widow marriageshad been brought about there by pecuniary and otherinducements, as if marriage itself was a great end for which allwell-wishers of the country ought to work.) The Swami\u2019sposition on the question was really as follows: that widowsshould be educated, homes should be established for them,and if they wished to marry they must be allowed the freedomto marry: only undue importance should not be given to theidea of marriage. A gentleman asked the Swami, \u201cBut if widowsmarry, they are excommunicated, and is it proper for us toforsake them, knowing that they have done nothing wrong?\u201d\u201cWell, if people excommunicate you, you must form a big caste1219and excommunicate them,\u201d was the Swami\u2019s ready reply. Thereformers fully agreed with this view of the Swami. 57VISwami Vivekananda delivered his second public lecture in theevening of 11 February 1897 at the Victoria Public Hall on\u201cThe Sages of India\u201d. The hall was packed to the full and amongthose present were the Hon\u2019ble Mr. Benson and Mrs. Benson,the Hon\u2019ble Subrahmanya Iyer, the Hon\u2019ble Mr. N. Subha Rao(in the Chair), Raja Sir S. Ramaswami Mudaliar and others.The Swami lectured for over an hour. He began with sayingthat our religion preaches an Impersonal Personal God \u2014 theSrutis which are the fountainhead being perfectly impersonaland the persons coming in the Smritis and the Puranas. Whileother religions are in the constant danger of crumbling downthe moment the historical existence of their founders wasquestioned, the Hindu religion had no such thing to fear. Krishnais not the authority of the Vedas. So it is with all our avatars,all our sages. The sage (Rishi) is the mantradrashta , the seerof thought, one who came face to face with spiritual verities.Coming down to later times, he spoke of Rama as theembodiment of truth, of morality \u2014 the ideal son, the idealhusband, the ideal father and, above all, the ideal king. \u201cSita\u201d,said he, \u201cis unique; that character was depicted once and forall. . . . She is the very type of the true Indian woman. . She hasgone into the very vitals of our race. . The women of Indiamust grow and develop in the footprints of Sita, and that is theonly way.\u201dSwami Vivekananda next described the life of Krishna,whom the writer of the Bhagavata was not content to call anavatar, and said he was the Lord Himself. He explained theTHE SAGES OF INDIASWAMI VIVEKANANDA1220episode of the gopis as illustrative of the most perfect love ofthe bhakta to the Lord. Until people become pure in everyrespect, the Swami continued to say, they are not fit tounderstand \u201cthat marvellous episode of the gopis .\u201d The Swamidescribed Krishna as the greatest of all incarnations, the greatlandmark in the history of religions. Krishna taught the idealof love for love\u2019s sake, duty for duty\u2019s sake, and work for work\u2019ssake. The Swami considered Krishna in another aspect as thepreacher of the Gita, \u201cthan which no better commentary on theVedas has been written, or can be written.\u201d He next dwelt uponthe avatar of  Buddha \u2014 the greatest and boldest preacher ofmorality \u2014 and said that it was a matter of history that theinstitution of temples and their paraphernalia followed in thewake of Buddhism. The disciples of Buddha, the Swami wenton to say, had misunderstood his noble teachings and becomea set of agnostic and irreligious people and prepared for theadvent of Sankara who reestablished the ancient truth as to theexistence of soul and of God which were denied by theshortsighted followers of Bhagavan Buddha. Sankara\u2019steachings were characterized by a wonderful liberalism ofintellect. Ramanuja, who followed Sankara, had an expansiveliberalism of the heart and worked for the elevation of thedowntrodden masses. Then came Chaitanya who began his lifeas a Professor of Logic but became a devout bhakta and apreacher of bhakti ultimately. He preached the religion of love.In concluding his address, the Swami gave an accountof his own guru, Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, whocombined in himself the liberalism of intellect of Sankara andthe expansiveness of heart of Chaitanya \u2014 one who saw inevery sect the same spirit working, the same God, whose heartwept for the poor and the downtrodden, and at the same timeone whose brilliant intellect conceived of such noble thoughts1221as would harmonize all conflicting sects, not only in India, butalso outside of India and bring a marvellous harmony, theuniversal religion of head and heart into existence. \u201cThe timewas ripe,\u201d the Swami said, \u201cit was necessary that such a manshould be born and he came; and the most wonderful part of itwas that his life\u2019s work was just near a city.. that had becomemore Europeanized than any other city in India. There he lived,without any book learning whatsoever; this great intellect neverlearnt even to write his own name, but the most brilliantgraduates of our university found in him an intellectual giant.It is a long,  long story, and I have no time to tell you anythingabout him tonight. Let me now only mention the greatSri Ramakrishna, the fulfillment of the Indian sages, the sagefor the time, one whose teaching is just now, in the presenttime, most beneficial. . . . If time comes, another opportunity,I will speak to you more fully about him. Only let me say nowthat if I have told you one word of truth, it was his and hisalone, and if I have told you many things which were not true,which were not correct, which were not beneficial to the humanrace, they were all mine, and on me is the responsibility.\u201d 58Besides delivering public lectures, in accordance with afixed programme and holding discourses at the Castle Kernan,Swami Vivekananda had many other engagements every day,of a few of which only we have some records. On the morningof 11 February 1897 he paid a visit to the house of the Hon\u2019bleJustice Mr. Subrahmanya Iyer in the Luz Church Road at thelatter\u2019s special invitation. His host treated him to sweet laddus,which he partook of in name, and the \u201cinevitable coffee,\u201d whichhe barely tasted. Prof. Iyer who was present tells us that, so faras he knew, the Swami was never a good eater. While stayingat his house at Trivandrum, he informs us, he had one lightmeal in daytime, and only a little milk at night. At this meeting,CHARITYSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1222Prof. Iyer says, the Swami unfolded to those present his plansfor a vast religious reformation in India which would serve tobring Hindus, Muhammadans, Christians, Buddhists and othersunder a common flag of brotherly union. The Swami alsowanted a new sort and style of temple with a hall containingstatues of the sages of all great religions and behind it andunderneath the open sky an inner precinct containing a pillarwith the letter (or letters) Om inscribed on it.On the following day, 12 February 1897, the Swami was,as we have seen above, exceptionally busy with the visitors atthe Castle Kernan. He had, besides, two public engagements.At about 4.30 p.m. he paid a visit to the Hindu TheologicalHigh School where two addresses were presented to him \u2014one on behalf of the school and another on that of the HinduMoral Association. The Swami, in his reply, congratulated thePresident founder of the school on his enterprise, which wasall the more creditable because the general tendency was torun down such institutions as superstitious, and calling uponall to encourage it. 59 The same evening he presided at the SixthAnniversary Meeting of the Madras Annadana Samajam, andafter the proceedings were over and a few speakers had dilatedon the importance of charity and specially of the free gift offood, made a few observations on the subject. Narrating hisexperience, during his travels, of one home where he himselfwas offered food but a Muslim companion of his was givensome money to buy his food with elsewhere, the Swami saidthat he was glad to learn that the Samajam did not make anydistinction between caste, or creed in the distribution ofcharities. According to the sastras, said he, the man whoreceived charity was greater than the one who gave, for theformer was for the time being representative of God and thelatter was merely a worshipper. Speaking on the question of1223discriminate and indiscriminate charity, the Swami said it wentwithout saying that there was a great deal of indiscriminatecharity in India. No country in the world had found out theremedy for indiscriminate charity. The institution of poor lawsin England was not acceptable to the poor man in Englandwho preferred to starve under a London Bridge to going to thepoorhouse. Though starving, the beggar was fond of liberty. Inevery country there must be a certain proportion of beggars solong as the disease called civilization lasted. If these poor weredriven away they took to thieving. A vagabond who was givena piece of bread continued to be only a vagabond, but one thatwas refused  it became a thief. In the latter case they had tokeep more jails and more police. Therefore, looked at evenfrom an economic point of view, Indian indiscriminate charitywas much better than the European poor law system. 60Swami Vivekananda\u2019s third public lecture in Madras wasdelivered in the evening of Saturday, 13 February 1897, at thePachaiyappa\u2019s Hall, the subject being \u201cThe Vedanta in itspractical application to Indian life\u201d. 61 The Swami said that theHindu religion was a collection, so to speak, of variousreligions, of various ideas, of various ceremonials and forms,all gathered together almost without a name and without achurch and without an organization. The only point where allthe sects agreed was that they believed in the scriptures \u2014 theVedas, of which the Jnanakanda, as embodying their spiritualteachings known as the Upanishads and the Vedanta, has beencited as the highest authority by all our teachers. He said thatthe Vedanta which customarily is identified by most peoplewith Advaitism, really covered the whole ground of Advaita(Monism), Visishtadvaita (Qualified Monism), and Dvaita(Dualism). It even took in part of Buddhism and Jainism too,for on closer analysis it was found that the essence of BuddhismPRACTICAL VEDANTASWAMI VIVEKANANDA1224was borrowed from the same Upanishads, and even the so-called great and wonderful ethics of Buddhism were there wordfor word in someone or other of the Upanishads. In theUpanishads were also found the germs of all the subsequentdevelopments of Hindu thought. Certain ludicrous attempts hadbeen made by persons without much Upanishadic scholarshipto trace bhakti to some foreign source, but all these attempts,as they knew, had been proved to be failures, and all that theywanted of bhakti was there even in the Samhitas , not to speakof the Upanishads. In the Samhita portions, they found tracesof that fear and tribulation \u2014 a worshipper quaking before aVaruna or any other gods. Now and then they were tortured bythe idea of sin, but the Upanishads had no place for thedelineation of these things. There is no religion of fear in theUpanishads: it is one of Love and one of Knowledge.\u201cThe Upanishadic literature was the most sublime in theworld. We have paintings of sublimity among all nations,wonderfully sublime passages, for instance, in the poetry ofMilton, Dante, Homer, etc. But there it is always a grasping atinfinity through the senses, the muscles, getting the ideal ofinfinite expansion, the infinite of space. There is a new languagein the Upanishads: it is almost negative, it is sometimes chaotic,sometimes taking you beyond the senses, pointing out to yousomething you cannot grasp, which you cannot sense, and atthe same time you feel sure that it is there. He quoted somesuch passages, \u201c Na tatra suryo bhati na chandratarakam, nemavidyuto bhanti, kuto\u2019yamagnih ( Katha , 2/2/15, Sve , 6/14,Munda , 2/2/10\" and \u201c Dva suparna sayuja, etc., Sve, 4/6, Mu3/1/1\u201d). If it be human literature, it must be the production of arace which had not yet lost its national vigour. \u201cStrength,strength is what the Upanishads speak to me from every page,\u201dsaid the Swami. This had been the great lesson that he had1225been taught in his life, namely to be strong and not to be weak.More weakness could not heal weakness. Could sin cure sin?\u201cStrength, Oh man, strength, says the Upanishad. \u201cAye! It isthe only literature in the world where you find the word, ` Abhih\u2018, \u201cfearless\u201d used again and again. In no other scripture in theworld is this adjective applied either to God or to man. And tomy mind arises from the past the vision of the great Emperorof the West, Alexander the Great, standing on the banks of theIndus talking to one of our sannyasis in the forest; and that oldman he was talking with perhaps naked, stark naked, sittingupon a block of stone, and the Emperor astonished at hiswisdom tempting him with  gold and honour to come backwith him to Greece, but the man refused. And then the Emperorstanding on his authority as Emperor says, `But I will kill youif you do not come\u2019 and the man bursts into laughter and hesays, `You never did tell such a lie as you do now. Who can killme; me you kill, Emperor of the material world! Never! for Iam the spirit unborn, never did I die. I am the infinite, theOmnipresent, the Omnipotent, you kill me, child that you are.\u2019\u201cYea, that is strength, that is strength and the more I readthe Upanishads, my friends, my countrymen, the more I weepfor you, for therein is the great practical application \u2014 strength,strength for us. What we need is strength. Who will give usstrength? There are thousands to weaken us. Stories we havelearnt enough. Every one of our Puranas if you press them givesus stories enough to fill three fourths of the libraries of theworld. We have all that. Everything that can weaken us as arace we have had for the last thousand years. Therefore let metell you that what we want is strength and the Upanishads arethe great mine of strength. Therein lies strength enough toinvigorate the whole world; the whole world can be vivified,made strong, energized, through them.PRACTICAL VEDANTASWAMI VIVEKANANDA1226\u201cThe second great idea that the world is waiting to receivefrom our Upanishads is the solidarity of the universe. When wego out of the country, we find the same brother man; whenthey come here they find the same brotherhood, the same cheer,the same Godspeed. Our Upanishads say that the cause of allmisery is ignorance, and that is perfectly true when applied toevery state of life, either social, or spiritual. It is ignorance thatmakes us hate each other; as soon as we know each other lovecomes, must come, for are we not one? Thus we find solidaritycoming in spite of itself. Even in politics and sociology,problems that were only national twenty years ago could nowno more  be solved on national grounds. They were assuminghuge proportions and could only be solved when looked at inthe broader light of international grounds. Internationalcombinations, international laws and internationalorganizations were the cry of the day. In science it was beingfound that the universe was one ocean of matter in which man,the sun and the moon and everything else were but the namesof different little whirlpools and nothing more, mentallyspeaking the same one universal ocean of thought in which allwere similar little whirlpools. As spirit it moveth not, changethnot, it is the one unchangeable, unbroken, homogeneous Atman.The cry of morality was also coming and that was in their books\u2014 the expansion of morality, the foundation of ethics, the worldwanted and it would get them.\u201cWhat do we want in India? If foreigners wanted thesethings, Indians wanted them twenty times more because theywere very weak. Physical weakness was the cause of at leastone third of their miseries. They were immensely selfish. Theyhad been fighting for centuries as to whether a certain markwas to be put one way or the other; writing volumes upon suchmomentous questions whether the look of one man spoilt1227another\u2019s food or not. They were not ashamed of these! Firstof all, our young men must be strong. Religion will comeafterwards. Be strong, my young friends. You will be nearer toheaven through football than through the study of the Gita.You will understand the Gita better with your biceps, yourmuscles, a little stronger. You will understand the mighty geniusand the mighty strength of Krishna better with a little of strongblood in you. You will understand the Upanishads better andthe glory of the Atman when your body stands firm upon yourfeet, and you feel yourselves as men.\u201d If he had a child, saidhe, he would, like Queen Madalasa, from its very birth beginto tell it, \u201cThou art the Pure One.\u201d They might be called sinners,but if all Englishmen believed that they were sinners indeed,they would be nothing better than the Negroes in the middle ofAfrica. Bless them they do not believe it. Have faith, asNachiketa. Liberty is the first condition of growth. \u201cWho areyou to solve women\u2019s problems? Are you the Lord God thatyou should rule over every widow and every woman?\u201d Handsoff! They will solve their own problems. Give up the idea thatby ruling someone you can do much good to them. You cannothelp anyone, you can only serve. Blessed are you that thatprivilege was given to you when others had it not. Do it only asa worship. You can do just as much as in the case of the plant;you can supply the growing seed with the materials for themaking up of its body bringing to it the earth, the water, the airthat it wants. It will take all that it wants by its own nature,assimilate and grow by its own nature.\u201cBring all light into the world. Light, bring light! Letlight come unto every one; the task will not be finished untileveryone has reached the Lord. Bring light to the poor; andbring more light to the rich, for they require it more than thepoor. Bring light to the ignorant, and more light to the educated,PRACTICAL VEDANTASWAMI VIVEKANANDA1228for the vanities of the education of our time are tremendous!Thus bring light to all and leave the rest unto the Lord, for inthe words of the same Lord, `To work you have the right andnot to the fruits thereof.\u2019 `Let not your work produce resultsfor you , and at the same time may you never be without work.\u2019May He who taught such grand ideas to our forefather\u2019s agesago, help us to get strength to carry to practise His commands.\u201dThe meeting terminated in the midst of loud andcontinued cheering. From the meeting the Swami seems to havegone to the residence of Mr. L. Govindas, Patter\u2019s Gardens,Royapettah, who had arranged for an entertainment in hishonour. Notwithstanding the fact that only very short noticewas given a large number of European and Indian gentlemenwere present. The Swami was presented with two addresses,one in English and the other in Sanskrit. Two clever musiciansentertained the audience with several tunes on the Vina andthe Guitar, after which Mr. Govindas presented the Swami withorange coloured silk clothes generally worn by sannyasis. Afterbeing garlanded and treated to refreshments, the Swami left. 62The fourth and last public lecture of Swami Vivekanandawas delivered on Sunday, 14 February 1897, the subject being\u201cThe Future of India\u201d. The Harmston Circus Pavilion where,as we have said above, this meeting was held, admitted a muchlarger gathering and over three thousand people attended it.The Hon\u2019ble Mr. N. Subha Rao Puntulu presided on theoccasion. \u201cThe Swami\u2019s oratory\u201d, says Prof. Iyer, \u201cwas at itsbest. He seemed like a lion, traversing the platform to and fro.The roar of his voice reverberated everywhere and with tellingeffect.\u201d 63 The very opening words of the address went deepinto the hearts of all in the vast audience, which listenedspellbound till the very end. The Swami said, \u201cThis is the1229ancient land where wisdom made its home before it went intoany other country, the same India whose influx of spiritualityis represented, as it were, on the material plane, by rolling riverslike oceans, where the eternal Himalayas, rising tier above tierwith their, snowcaps, look as it were into the very mysteries ofheaven. Here is the same India whose soil has been trodden bythe feet of the greatest sages that ever lived. Here first sprangup enquiries into the nature of man and into the internal world.Here first arose the doctrines of the immortality of the soul,the existence of a supervising God, and immanent God in natureand in man, and here the highest ideals of religion andphilosophy have attained their culminating points. This is theland from whence, like tidal waves, spirituality and philosophyhave again and  again rushed out and deluged the world, andthis is the land from whence once more such ideas must proceedin order to bring life and vigour into the decaying races ofmankind. It is the same India which has stood the shock ofcenturies, of hundreds of foreign invasions, of hundreds ofupheavals of manners and customs. It is the same land thatstands firmer than any rock in the world with its undying vigour,indestructible life. Its life is of the same nature as the soul,without beginning and without end, immortal; and we are thechildren of such a country.\u201dThe Swami continued to say that there had been periodsof decay and degradation which were necessary and out ofwhich the future India was coming \u2014 like the Urdhvamulatree. 64 The problems in India were more complicated and moremomentous than those of any other country. Race, language,religion, government, all these made a nation. Of languagesthe most wonderful conglomerations were here. In mannersand customs, there is more difference between two Indian racesthan between two European or any other nations. The onePRACTICAL VEDANTASWAMI VIVEKANANDA1230common ground the Indians had was their sacred tradition andtheir religion and upon that one ground they would have tobuild. In Europe political ideals formed the national unity; inAsia religious ideas. Unity in religion was therefore absolutelynecessary as the first condition of the future of India. In Indiaall race difficulties, language difficulties, and nationaldifficulties would melt away before this unifying power ofreligion. To the Indian mind there was no greater ideal than thereligious ideal; that was the keynote to Indian life. They couldonly work on the line of least resistance. All of us have to betaught that our religion, despite denominational differences,has certain common ideas. We must forget these little quarrelsand differences, so that our religion may be strengthened. Howto do it? \u201cI will lay before you my ideas. They have been in mymind for a long time, even years before  I left the shores ofIndia for America, and that I went to America and Englandwas simply for propagating these ideas. I did not care at all forthe Parliament of Religions or anything else; it was simply anopportunity; for it was really those ideas of mine that took meall over the world.\u201dThe solution of unification was not to bring down thehigher to the lower but by raising the lower up to the level ofthe higher. That was the line of work. At the one end they hadas the ideal the Brahmin, at the other end they had the Chandalasand the whole work was to raise the Chandalas up to the levelof the Brahmins. He was sorry to see that especially in thisPresidency there was so much fighting between castes. Thatmust go. Caste exclusiveness and caste privileges were uselesson both sides. Those days were gone. The duty of everyaristocracy was to dig its own grave and the sooner it did thebetter. It was the duty of the Brahmin, therefore, to work forthe salvation of the races in India. It was to Brahmin selfishness1231that they owed the degradation of other castes. There is an oldsuperstition in Bengal that if the cobra, that bites, sucks out hisown poison from the patient, the man must survive. Well then,the Brahmin must suck out his own poison. The Brahmins werethe custodians of the literature. They must break open thetreasury and give it to everybody. The Brahmin must do it first.The nonBrahmin castes had always been sleepy and lazyand hence this race as it were between hare and tortoise! Letthem not get hold of every opportunity of fighting the Brahminsince it was their fault that they were low now. Let them allstudy Sanskrit and acquire the culture of the Brahmin and noone would dispute then their equality. While condemning thehigh caste people for the diabolical treatment of the low castepeople he exhorted the latter not to fight the high caste men,but try to acquire the Sanskrit culture. The only thing for thenon Brahmin to do was to wait and not be in too great a hurry.The giving up of caste privileges would bring them into anorganized body and the whole problem would be then tocoordinate their will powers. \u201cFor the next fifty years this aloneshall be our keynote \u2014 this, our great Mother India. Let allother vain gods disappear for that time from our minds. This isthe only god that is awake, our own race, everywhere his hands,everywhere his feet, everywhere his ears, he covers everything.All other gods are sleeping. What vain gods shall we go afterand yet cannot worship the god that we see all around us, theVirat?. . The first of all worship is the worship of the Virat \u2014of all those around us. Worship It.\u201dThe Indians must have a hold on the spiritual and seculareducation of the nation. The education that they were gettingnow had some good points, but it was not a man makingeducation, it was merely and entirely a negative education.PRACTICAL VEDANTASWAMI VIVEKANANDA1232Their young ones, as soon as they entered schools, were taughtthat their parents were fools, their sacred literature a bundle oflies and by the time they were sixteen years old, were a hopelessmass of negation, lifeless and boneless. We must have lifebuilding, man making, character making, assimilation of ideas.Their education, therefore, must be on national lines and intheir own hands, as far as possible. He wanted to establish atemple and an institution here (in Madras) to train teachersand preachers and to carry religion to the door of every one, asalso secular education. \u201cMoney is not needed. Money isnothing. . . . Where are the men? That is the question. Youngmen of Madras, my hope is in you. Will you respond to the callof the nation?. . This is the time to decide your future \u2014 whileyou possess the energy of youth. . Work; this is the time, forthe freshest, the untouched and unsmelt  flowers alone are tobe laid at the feet of the Lord, and such He receives. . Life isshort, but the  soul is immortal and eternal, and one thing beingcertain, death, let us therefore take up a great ideal, and giveup our whole life to it. May the great Krishna bless us, andlead us all to the fulfillment of our aims.\u201dGreat enthusiasm had prevailed throughout the meetingand there were loud and prolonged cheers when it wasannounced that the Swami would visit Madras every year. 65Man proposes and it is for God to dispose. We have spokenmany times above about the Swami\u2019s state of health, whichhad alarmingly deteriorated during the last two years of hisstay in the West, and his urgent need of rest, which he expectedhe would have once he got back to his motherland. He wroteto Mary Hale from Ramnad on 30 January 1897, \u201cFromColombo. . to Ramnad my journey has been a hugeprocession. . . . Madras and Calcutta are on the tiptoe ofexpectation as if the whole nation is rising to honour me. . . . I1233am on the very height of my destiny, yet the mind turns toquietness and peace. . . .\u201d 66 At Madras, Prof. Iyer and othersimmediately noticed how changed, from the point of view ofhealth, he had become from the vigorous young man that hewas when he left for America, and wondered how at all heresponded to the demands made on \u201chis almost exhausted stockof energy.\u201d 67 It was because of this that they dissuaded otherpeople who wanted him to stay at Madras for a month frompressing it on the Swami, and all agreed that he should be inMadras for just ten days. On 12 February, Swami Vivekanandawrote to Swami Brahmananda, \u201cI am to start by s.s. Mombasanext Sunday. I had to give up invitations from Poona and otherplaces on account of bad health. I am very much pulled downby hard work and heat.\u201d 68 In Calcutta, too, hard work awaitedhim. On 25 February he wrote to Mrs. Bull, \u201cI do not knowwhether I would live even six months more or not, unless Ihave some rest.\u201d 69It was with heavy heart and many prayers to God for hissafety and health that the people of Madras bade him goodbye.70 Though it was known that the Swami would come to the pierat about 8 a.m., groups of people began to gather there from asearly as four o\u2019clock in the morning, and as the hour drew nearfor his departure several thousands had collected on the beach.In the pier, a spacious and elegant pavilion had been put upand the place from pavilion to shore was gaily decorated withbuntings and banners. The Swami and party, who arrived athalf past seven, were conducted to the shamiana, where hewas met by the Reception Committee and others. Severalmerchants of the caste of AryaVaishyas (known as Komatis)met him and presented a formal address of thanksgiving forhis services to the motherland. The Hon\u2019ble Mr. Subha Rao ofRajahmundry presented the address to the Swami on theirADIEU MADRASSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1234behalf. 71 After a brief conversation and after being garlanded,the party, amidst deafening cheers, got into the pier trolley andwere trollied up to shore end. The Hon\u2019ble Mr. Subha Rao andothers wished him Godspeed and a safe voyage. The Swamireplied that his silence would best express his feelings andproceeded to enter the boat. Several, including the membersof the Reception Committee, got into the vessel. An amusingincident then happened. His admirers had arranged for greencoconuts being stored in the steamer, so that the Swami whofelt frequently thirsty because of the illness he had contractedfrom severe brain work in the West, might slake his thirst. As ahuge number of them were being brought in boats for beingtaken aboard, Mrs. Sevier, who did not know what or whomthey were meant for, was annoyed, and asked the Swami, \u201cIsthis a cargo boat, Swamiji, that they are loading so manycoconuts aboard?\u201d The Swami laughed and explained to herthat that had been arranged for by his kind friends who wantedhim, as advised by the physicians, to drink coconut milk insteadof water during his weeklong  voyage. 72 A little before thesteamer lifted anchor, Prof. Iyer managed to have a few minutes\u2019conversation with the Swami. He asked two questions, first\u201cSwamiji, tell me, if indeed you have done lasting good byyour mission to such materialistic people as the Americansand others in the West?\u201d He replied, \u201cNot much. I hope thathere and there I have sown a seed which in time may grow andbenefit some at least.\u201d The second question was, \u201cShall we seeyou again, and will you continue your Mission work in SouthIndia?\u201d He replied, \u201cHave no doubt about that. I shall takesome rest in the Himalayan regions and then burst on thecountry everywhere like an avalanche.\u201d God disposes. Neveragain was Prof. Iyer, or most of the thousands who longed tohave another sight of the Swami, to meet him again, nor couldthe Swami once again set his foot in his beloved Southern India.1235VIIThe weeklong voyage by ship which, for reasons of health,had been preferred to a quick journey by rail, did prove to bebeneficial to the Swami\u2019s tired nerves. He made friends withthe Captain of the ship and his fellow passengers with whomhe shared the coconuts. The Swami was specially happy, forhis companions on board the ship included, besides his Englishdisciples, three of his most devout Madrasi disciples, viz.,Alasinga Perumal, G. G. Narasimhacharya, and SingaraveluMudaliar (Kidi). When the steamer sailed up the Hooghly, theSwami pointed out to his disciples all the places of interest,which he knew very well. (He later contributed an interestingaccount of these places to the Udbodhana while he was on hissecond voyage to the West, December, 1899. This is nowavailable to us in his Memories of European Travel. ) In duetime, in the night of Thursday, 18 February 1897, the steameranchored off at Budge Budge. Two gentlemen had beendispatched by  the Reception Committee to inform him of thereception planned. They told him that when the steamer woulddock at Kidderpore on the following morning, a special trainwould be in waiting to convey him and his party to SealdahStation.73We need not worry ourselves here about the question,on which there are differences of opinion, as to whether theSwami\u2019s reception in Calcutta was on a greater or a smallerscale than that in Madras. Every Bengali heart was throbbingwith delight at the thought of one who had for ever and everglorified the name of Bengal, and every Bengali was keenlyawaiting the day of his homecoming. At the moment, theprovince, which had already come into limelight for nationalconsciousness and patriotic fervour, was afflicted with famineGRAND RECEPTION AT CALCUTTASWAMI VIVEKANANDA1236and the minds of the people were uneasy as stories of sufferingand starvation in the countryside were reaching the cities.Nevertheless, as in Madras, the idea of giving the Swami afitting reception had seized men\u2019s minds as early as it wasknown that he had left London for India. It was voiced in TheIndian Mirror in a letter from a correspondent dated 27December 1896. 74 At a well-attended meeting held at theresidence of Raja Benoy Krishna Deb Bahadur at Sobha Bazaron 24 January 1897 an influential Reception Committee wasformed to organize a fitting reception to the Swami. It wasannounced that the Maharaja of Darbhanga had consented tobe the President of the Reception Committee and Raja BenoyKrishna Deb Bahadur to act as Secretary and Treasurer. (Afew days later, the Maharaja of Darbhanga intimated hisunwillingness to act as President, ostensibly on the ground ofa pre-engagement but really, it was said, under pressure oforthodox opinion, which was voiced, among others, by theBangabashi newspaper, and was highly critical of the Swami.Raja Benoy Krishna was, thereupon, named President andMr. Narendra Nath Sen, Editor, The Indian Mirror, Secretary.)Unprecedented enthusiasm prevailed in Calcutta onFriday, 19 February 1897, the day of Swami Vivekananda\u2019sarrival at Sealdah station. From early daybreak, people werepouring into the eastern platform, where the train was to arriveand by 7.30 a.m., its due time, a crowd of some 20,000 personshad collected on it and the adjoining ground as also the roadsand streets all-round the station, to honour the Swami and givehim a hearty reception. The route from the railway station toRipon College (now renamed Surendra Nath College) inHarrison Road, where the Swami was to halt for half an hour,was decorated on both sides with festoons of coloured papercut out in the shape of banners. A triumphal arch, having a1237nahabatkhana on top, was erected in Circular Roadimmediately outside the station premises, having the words,\u201cHail, Swamiji\u201d. Another arch, displaying the words \u201cJaiRamakrishna\u201d, spanned Harrison Road, and a third arch havingthe word \u201cWelcome\u201d on it was erected in front of RiponCollege. As Swamiji was coming by a special train, of whichthe exact time of arrival was not generally known, there wastense excitement and people were enquiring of one another,\u201cWhat more delay for the Swami\u2019s arrival?\u201d. Some people werereading two pamphlets, printed in English, which were beingdistributed freely. They were the farewell addresses which theAmericans and Englishmen had presented to the Swami onthe eve of his departure from the West. 75Punctual to time, the special steamed in and theappearance of Swami Vivekananda at the carriage door wasgreeted with vociferous cheering. Immediately there was a greatrush, everybody being anxious to get near to him and take thedust of his feet and people could with difficulty keep theirplaces. As the Swami alighted on the platform, Mr. NarendraNath Sen, followed by other members of the ReceptionCommittee, welcomed the Swami and placed a garland offlowers round his neck. A crowd of  young men carrying flagsshowed him the way to the conveyance, which was in readinessfor him. Mrs. and Mr. Sevier, who accompanied the Swami,were also escorted to the carriage. His Madrasi disciples weretaken good care of and seated in carriages. Hardly had theSwami with Mrs. and Mr. Sevier seated themselves in thecarriage when the horses were unharnessed and a band of fine-looking boys, mostly students, rushed forward to draw it. 76There was a stream of carriages following the Swami\u2019s carriageand the Swami was heartily cheered throughout the passage, aconcert party leading the way in a charabanc. There was aGRAND RECEPTION AT CALCUTTASWAMI VIVEKANANDA1238peculiar smile in the beaming countenance of the Swami andhis picturesque orange cloth fitted him admirably. He frequentlybowed to the crowd with joined palms and throughout evinceda simple and touching recognition of the unprecedentedreception.The procession wended its way slowly till it reachedRipon College at quarter to eight. The crowd there was so greatthat it was impossible to get into the Hall. The Hon\u2019ble AnandaCharlu and several respectable gentlemen were there. Severalof the very respected men of the community had to come awayas there was hardly any room. In the spacious tent yard of theCollege, the Swami and his friends were seated and the wholeassembly cheered him heartily. Meanwhile, there were somedisorderly scenes near the College gates, against which a hugecrowd, anxious to get in, was pressing heavily. At somebody\u2019sfoolish orders, the gates were flung open with the result thatthose who were in front, mostly boys, were pushed forwardwith force. Many of them fell and were being trampled uponwhen some men possessing sticks used them to put back thecrowd and quickly picked them up. Had it not been for theirpresence of mind, many of the boys would have been trampledto death. Even then some were badly hurt. In its issue of thefollowing day. The Indian Mirror made some caustic commentson \u201cdisorderly crowds, that are not evidently disciplined to puton any restraint on their impulses.\u201d 77 But it is not knownwhether in his capacity as Secretary of the ReceptionCommittee the venerable editor had considered it to be a partof his duty to request the authorities to make special policearrangements to meet the situation. In any case, as TheStatesman reported, no such arrangements were in evidenceeither at the railway station, or along the route, to maintainorder.781239Why a short halt at Ripon College had been decided uponby the Reception Committee it is difficult to understand.Nothing worth mentioning was done there, the ReceptionCommittee having already announced the postponement of theformal and public reception until a week later. However, aftera short while, Swami Vivekananda and his party left forBaghbazar where they had been invited to a banquet by RaiPashupati Nath Bose Bahadur at his palatial residence. At fouro\u2019clock in the afternoon, the Swami and his English friendswere driven to a splendid garden house at Cossipore, the ownerof which, Babu Gopal Lal Sil, a grandson of the famous businessmagnate and humanitarian, Babu Motilal Sil, the doyen of theSubarnabanik Community of Calcutta, had placed it at thedisposal of the Reception Committee to be used as thetemporary residence of the Swami and his English friends. TheSwami\u2019s Madrasi disciples were accommodated in theAlambazar Math, where the Swami usually passed his nightsin their company, after spending the daytime with his Englishfriends at the Sil\u2019s garden house at Cossipore. Rest was whatthe Swami badly needed but of it he had practically none, asthe following facts indicate. Daily he had to negotiate thedistance between Cossipore and Alambazar, (at least two anda half miles) presumably on foot, and even if sometimes acarriage was available for the  purpose, it was most probablyone of the thikagarhis (carriages on hire) which for their fragileframes and miserable, famished horses were ready objects ofpopular jokes. Apart from this routine alternation of hisheadquarters (Cossipore and Alambazar) by day and night andnecessary journeys to and fro, he was constantly coming andgoing, as well, from the house of one devotee ofSri Ramakrishna to another. Frequently he was called for dinnerat the house of one or other of them as also elsewhere. One ofthe first things he did on reaching Calcutta, we may be sure,GRAND RECEPTION AT CALCUTTASWAMI VIVEKANANDA1240was to meet his mother and, for aught we know, with all hispreoccupations, he repeated his visits to her many times. In anarticle in the Brahmavadin, June, 1911, entitled \u201cSwamiVivekananda \u2014 His Childhood and Boyhood\u201d, from whichwe have occasionally quoted in the early Chapters of this book,a touching story is narrated. \u201cAfter his glorious career in theWest, he came and met his mother. With his head or her lap,with all the pranks and helplessness of a child, he cried, `Mother,feed me with thine hands and make me grow.\u2019\u201dSwami Vivekananda stayed in Calcutta till 8 March 1897when, as we shall see, for urgent reasons of health, he went toDarjeeling. We do not know how long he stayed at Gopal LalSil\u2019s garden house, but we are sure that he did not stay thereduring all these days, though his English disciples may havecontinued to do so till they left for Darjeeling. For some daysat a stretch Swamiji stayed at the residence of the late BalaramBose where, as we know, Sri Ramakrishna sometimes cameand even stayed overnight. It had been announced that he wouldreceive visitors every day between 3 p.m. and 8 p.m. but actuallythe latter poured in at all hours, wherever he stayed, or camefor a visit. Among them were distinguished public men, suchas Mr. Narendra Nath Sen, the editor of The Indian Mirror,scholars thirsting for knowledge, pedants who wanted to testhis learning and powers, enthusiastic youths and collegestudents, besides common people who wanted to have just thedust of his feet. With unfailing courtesy he listened to hisquestioners, who were charmed with his knowledge andinterpretation of the sastras, and even savants acknowledgedhis genius. The Swami\u2019s heart, however, was with the educatedand unmarried youths, whom he hoped to recruit as fightersfor the cause to which he himself had dedicated his life. In hislast speech at Madras he had made an impassioned appeal to1241the youth of the province for dedication and service. As weshall see, he was publicly to do so in his first address before aCalcutta audience. Some such high souled youths had alreadyheard the call in their hearts and, as if drawn by a powerfulmagnet, they came one by one to him at the garden house inresponse to it, some receiving their initiation into sannyasadirectly from him. Among them were Sudhir and Khagen (laterknown as Swami Suddhananda and Swami Vimalanandarespectively) who met him on the very day of the Swami\u2019sarrival in Calcutta at Pashupati Babu\u2019s house.From the published reminiscences of some of these youngmen, we have glimpses of Swamiji during these days as alsosome idea of the conversations he had with people at the gardenhouse and elsewhere. Amongst these, the work that containsthe fullest account of the conversations is Swami Sishya Samvad(The Dialogues between the Swami and his Disciple) by SaratChandra Chakravarti, which in the literature of the RamakrishnaMovement ranks with, or is perhaps next only to, theSri Sri Ramakrishna Kathamrita by Mahendra Nath Gupta.There was not much in these conversations which SwamiVivekananda had not expressed earlier in many places and thereader is familiar with them. We shall, however, give a briefaccount of them here. The Swami had varying moods as visitorsof different  temperaments came to him and put him questionsand as usual his replies were such as met the requirements. Ayoung man who, being advised by the Swami to look aroundand minister to the needs of the poor, the sick and the helplessinstead of meditating with closed eyes in his room, had objectedthat in attempting to do so he might damage his own health.The Swami told him that he need have no such fears becausewith his mentality he would never take any risks whatsoever.One day, Mahendra Nath Gupta, (the venerable MasterGRAND RECEPTION AT CALCUTTASWAMI VIVEKANANDA1242Mahashay ) came on a visit, and asked the Swami, \u201cYou speakof service, charity and doing good to the world; do they not toobelong to the domain of maya ? When the goal of Vedanta wasmukti (liberation) and the breaking of all the bondage of maya,what is the use of your preaching those things which bring themind down to mundane matters?\u201d Swamiji\u2019s curt reply madehis questioner speechless, \u201cDoes not the idea of mukti also liewithin the realm of maya ? Atman (the Self) is nityamukta (everfree). Hence, what necessity is there for you to attempt for it?\u201dMahendra Nath Gupta was not the only brother discipleof the Swami who found it difficult to accept his gospel ofservice to humanity. In an earlier Chapter we have seen howhis interpretation of Sri Ramakrishna\u2019s dictum, sivajnanejivaseva (service of all creatures in the knowledge that theyare God), could not receive the hearty endorsement of all hisbrother disciples. We have also narrated how many of the latter,who thought that they had a different conception of the Master\u2019steachings, refused to accept his modest proposal, when theywere living together at Baranagore Math, that they should goto the neighbouring villages and preach to the outcastes whodwelt there. When the story of Swami Vivekananda\u2019s triumphsin the West reached them, they were happy to learn that he wasno other than their beloved Narenbhai. But later, when thecontent of his teachings there became known to them morefully, some of them demurred, thinking that they were notconsonant with the teachings of the Master. A few of themeven had the queer idea, which they freely talked about in thecircle of Sri Ramakrishna\u2019s devotees, that he was suppressingthe Master and exalting himself \u2014 with the ultimate object ofsetting himself up as a Mohanta (Abbot of a monastery)!Mahendranath Datta tells us that in thus criticizing the Swamithe lead was taken by Swami Premananda who, in association1243with Haramohan Mitra and a few others, got a pamphlet printed,at the bottom of the cover page of which the words, SwamiVivekananda, were given in small letters and the wordsdescribing him, viz., Disciple of Lord Ramakrishna, in boldcapitals. Swami Ramakrishnananda, Swami Abhedananda, andothers rebuked him but he went on with his campaign \u201cas onepossessed by an evil spirit.\u201d He was brought to his senses whenSwamiji\u2019s first letter to his brother monks was received at theMath and he found that every syllable of it was eloquent of hisreverence for his Master. 79 In subsequent letters Swamijiexplained why it was not expedient just then to boost his ownguru. Though Swami Premananda was cured of his mania, someof the monks continued to be sceptical and to question whetherSwamiji was on the right track.The matter did not end here and the differences of opinionbetween Swamiji and his brother disciples were to be spelt outagain and again. Coming back to our narration of theconversations of this period (up to the early days of March),we find Swamiji being asked one day what was the differencebetween an avatara and a muktapurusha. He explained thematter indirectly as follows, \u201cIn my opinion, Videhamukti isthe highest stage.\u201d He went on to say that at one time he wasso much bent on realizing it that, seeing that he could not getit, he decided  many a time to give up the body by starvation.Now, however, said he, he had no desire for it and did not careto have it as long as a single individual in the world remainedwithout attaining it. We need not dilate on the subject furtherhere, because we have referred to and explained Swamiji\u2019sdistinctive view on it a number of times in the precedingChapters. It may, however, be mentioned that (as has beenpointed out by the authors of The Life ) Swami Vivekananda,like Gautama Buddha and other great souls, who rose aboveGRAND RECEPTION AT CALCUTTASWAMI VIVEKANANDA1244mukti (personal salvation) did so after they had attained it.The difference between an avatara and a muktapurusha wouldthen seem to lie in the fact that while the former, with mukti inthe palm of his hand as it were does not want to be merged inthe Absolute and lives in the world for doing good to othersand raising them to the highest state, the latter, after giving uphis body in samadhi moves about the world as a freed soulwith his mind always absorbed in God.80A similar idea came up in the course of a conversationthat a preacher of the Gorakshini Sabha (Cow ProtectionSociety) had with him one day while he was on a visit toPriyanath Mukherjee\u2019s house (in the last week of February,1897). On being told by him that the object of the society wasto save cows from the hands of butchers by buying them andtaking care of old, decrepit and diseased cows in pinjrapoles(infirmaries) established by themselves, the Swami said that itwas an excellent idea. He, however, enquired what the societywas doing to relieve suffering in Central India where, accordingto a Government report, nine lakhs of people were starvingbecause of the famine raging there. The preacher replied thatthe object of their society was to save the gomatas (cowsregarded as Mother) only and not help in famines, adding thatfamines occurred because of men\u2019s karma, their sins. TheSwami was angry - sparks of  fire, as it were, scintillated in hiseyes and his face was flushed. But suppressing his emotionshe said, \u201cI have no sympathy for men who allow their ownbrothers to die of starvation and instead spend millions forproviding birds and animals with food. If it is for their karmathat men die in famines, then it is useless to try or struggle foranything in the world. That way, it may be argued that gomatasalso fall into the hands of butchers for their karma. \u201c Thepreacher admitted that it was so but, said he, according to the1245sastras, the cow is our mother. The Swami smilingly said, \u201cYes,that the cow is your mother I can very well understand; whoelse could give birth to such accomplished children!\u201d Thepreacher was too dense to understand the point of the Swami\u2019sridicule and went on with his pleading for a subscription forhis society. He left only after he had extorted a promise fromthe Swami that he would do something if he had some moneyleft after he had first done something for men. After the preacherleft, the Swami told his listeners, \u201cDid you see to what amonstrous extreme the theory of karma is dragged? Are theymen who do not feel for man?\u201d 81The widely circulated story that Swami Vivekananda hadpreached Vedanta in the West had, unfortunately, producedsome misconceptions in the circles of certain sects which didnot subscribe to the tenets of Advaita (absolute monism). Somepeople had the idea that the Swami was stern Advaitin (monist),that he placed Jnana above Bhakti, and they somehow inferredthat he did not quite accept the gospel of love that Sri Chaitanyahad proclaimed to be the best suited for Kali Yuga. In a leadingarticle in the Amrita Bazar Patrika, dated 8 February 1897,the editor, Sisir Kumar Ghosh, who was a devout Vaishnava,commented on the attitude of Swami Vivekananda towardsSri Chaitanya in a roundabout manner, as follows. He wrote,\u201cWe are sorry to see that Swami Vivekananda has not thatfriendly  feeling towards the works of Mrs. Besant and theTheosophical Society, as we think he ought to have. . . . Fancythe spectacle of an American Colonel and a Russian ladycoming to India and awakening in the hearts of the degenerateHindus a respect for their own religion. . . . . As for Mrs. Besant,. . . . she is preaching the religion of the Gita . . . . to the samestrange peoples addressed to by Swami Vivekananda. So theworks of the Swami and Mrs. Besant are precisely of the sameINTERVIEWS AND CONVERSATIONSSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1246character; nay, honestly speaking, Mrs. Besant has gone a stepfurther than even the Swami himself, for Mrs. Besant hasventured to present Sree Krishna to the strange people, whichthe Swami has not yet been able to find his way to do.\u201d 82Swamiji\u2019s observations on the charge that he had not, in hiszeal for Vedantism, presented other aspects of Hinduism,specially Vaishnavism, were made in the course of aconversation that a Vaishnava sadhu, who made a similarcomplaint to him, had with him at this time. The Swami said,\u201cBabaji, once I gave a lecture in America on Sri Krishna. Itmade such an impression on a young and beautiful womanthat she renounced everything and retired to a solitary island,where she passed her days absorbed in the meditation ofSri Krishna.\u201d 83On Swamiji\u2019s attitude to Vaishnavism we have spokenoff and on in the preceding pages of this work. The reader isalready aware of the profound reverence that the Swami hadfor Sri Krishna and may recall what he said about Him and theepisode of the gopis in his second public lecture in Madras,entitled \u201cThe Sages of India\u201d. We shall finish our narration ofthe Swami\u2019s conversations of this period with two more stories.One day, at the garden house, a company of Gujarati Panditscame for a disputation with him on Indian philosophy. Thediscussion was on many subjects but the main topic was therespective merits of the Purva and the Uttara Mimamsas, theSwami supporting the latter. The Pandits began their discussionin Sanskrit, no doubt as a challenge to the Swami to respond inthat language. To the amazement of his gurubhais, he not onlydid so fluently but in better literary style, his melodious voiceenlivening what was a forbidding scholarly disputation. Onceonly he committed a trifling grammatical mistake, at onceapologized and corrected himself, but the Pandits laughed1247immodestly. So far as the discussion itself was concerned, thePandits were worsted and \u201cwere obliged to accept the Swami\u2019sconclusions.\u201d 84 It is interesting to learn that as the discussionswent on, Swami Ramakrishnananda was all the while sittingapart in meditation posture, counting his beads and praying toGod for the success of his gurubhai. After the Pandits departed,the Swami who had had disputations enough in the West too,as we have seen, said that, over there, people were concernedwith the spirit in an argument rather than in verbal flaws andthat at any rate they never committed such incivilities aslaughing at a grammatical blunder of their opponents.If the visit of the Pandits was an infliction and theirdiscussion with the Swami a sheer waste of his time, therewere other visits which were both welcome and fruitful. Oneday, Mr. Narendra Nath Sen, the editor of The Indian Mirror,came to meet the Swami at the house of Priyanath Mukherjee.(He left a little before the Cow Protection Society preacher,about whom we have spoken above, turned up.) Mr. Sen, aswe have seen, was an admirer and supporter of the Swami whenhe was in the West and, we may add here, remained so till theend. He had not been misunderstood even when, after theSwami\u2019s open attack on the Theosophists in his first publicspeech in Madras, he, himself belonging to that sect, hadexpressed his disapproval of it (in mild language) and, out ofjournalistic etiquette, thrown open the columns of his paper tocorrespondents,  who were both favourable to and critical, evendenunciatory, of the Swami\u2019s stand on Theosophy. If he hadaccepted much foolish stuff from the Swami\u2019s opponents, asfor example a letter containing the remark that the Swami\u2019sgrammar was such as was sure to make Bain and Murray turnin their graves, he had rejected a letter (which was forthwithpublished by the Amrita Bazar Patrika ) which contained aINTERVIEWS AND CONVERSATIONSSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1248false and malicious accusation against the Swami.85 Thediscussion between the two men, one a man of religion and theother of politics, who, however, were alike in the genuinenessof their love for the motherland, was very friendly. The Swamistressed that, by the kind of interchange between the East andthe West that he advocated, both were likely to benefit. If theWest learned about the lofty philosophy of India, it would havegreater respect for India and sympathy with the materially lowpresent-day conditions of our people. This was already inevidence to some extent, said the Swami. If we have their realsympathy and regard, he added, we would learn from them thesciences bearing on our material life, thereby qualifyingourselves better for the struggle for existence. On the otherhand, by learning the Vedanta from us, they will be enabled tosecure their own spiritual welfare.Mr. Sen asked if by this kind of interchange we may hopeto progress politically, by which perhaps he meant and at anyrate the Swami seems to have taken him to mean, whether wemay ultimately beat them with their own weapons. The Swamisaid that we could never hope to do so and that people wouldbe profoundly mistaken if they thought that \u201cwe shall in caseof conflict with them gain freedom by applying those materialforces.\u201d On the other hand, by preaching Vedanta to them weshall forever maintain the position of their teachers, while theywill remain our teachers in all material concerns. The day wesit at their feet in spiritual matters, we shall be dead as a nation,said the Swami, obviously reiterating his position, about whichwe have said a number of times, in respect of the Theosophicalmovement. No good can come, added the Swami, by cryingday and night before them, again obviously giving his mind onthe policy adopted by our political leaders of adoptingresolutions in the meetings of the Indian National Congress1249and elsewhere begging for constitutional reforms. The Swamiconcluded as follows: \u201cTo me the pursuit of politics is asecondary means in comparison with this. . If you believe inany other way of accomplishing the good of India, you may goon working in your own way.\u201d Mr. Sen left fully satisfied withthe Swami. Another welcome visitor was Sri RamlalChattopadhyay, who was a nephew of Sri Ramakrishna andwas endearingly called Ramlal Dada by the Brotherhood. Assoon as he entered his room, the Swami got up from the chairand in spite of his protestations made him sit on it, while hestrolled about the room saying to himself, gurubat guruputreshu(on should treat the son of a guru as he would treat the guruhimself).Before proceeding to deal with Swami Vivekananda\u2019sfurther activities of the period in Calcutta, we may refer to thefact that it was a great comfort to him to receive letters fromhis Western disciples and friends as also reports of the progressof the Vedanta Societies in England and America. We are notsure as to the dates on which these communications weredispatched, or received, but some of them seem to have beenreceived by the Swami in Calcutta. (In a letter to Mrs. Bullfrom the Alambazar Math, Calcutta, dated 25 February 1897,the Swami said that he had received an address from theCambridge Association as well as one from the BrooklynEthical Association, but not yet the one from the VedantaAssociation of New York, as mentioned in Dr. Janes\u2019s letter.The first mentioned letter seems to have been received by theSwami soon after he reached  Calcutta, for a copy of it waspublished in The Indian Mirror in its issue of 5 March 1897with the remark that it had been \u201cjust received from Americaby Srimat Swami Vivekananda.\u201d) 86 It began with the address,\u201cDear Friend and Brother\u201d and was signed by ten eminentINTERVIEWS AND CONVERSATIONSSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1250persons, including Dr. Lewis G. Janes, President of the BrooklynEthical Association, William James, the famous philosopher,Professors Wright, Royce, and Everett, who were headsrespectively of Greek, Philosophy and Divinity Departmentsof Harvard University, Professors J. E. Lough and Rachel KentTaylor, who were Presidents respectively of the HarvardGraduate Philosophical Association and Radcliff PhilosophicalClub, and Mrs. Sara Ole Bull, who was the promoter of theCambridge Conferences.The signatories to this address recognized the value ofthe Swami\u2019s able expositions of the \u201cphilosophy and religionof Vedanta in America and the interest created thereby amongthinking people.\u201d They thought, said they, that his work, whichwas being continued by Swami Saradananda, had more thanspeculative interest. It had, in their opinion, great ethical valuein cementing the ties of brotherhood between distant peoplesand helping men to realize the solidarity of human relationships.They expected that Swami Vivekananda would return toAmerica \u201cwith assurances of fraternal regard from our distantbrothers of our great Aryan Family\u201d and wanted to knowsomething about his own plans, in particular whether they couldanticipate his presence with them again as a teacher. The addressof the Brooklyn Ethical Association was equally eulogistic ofthe Swami\u2019s work in America and much to the same effect.(This seems to have been received in Madras, where copies ofit were printed and widely circulated.) Still another addresswas received by the Swami, it being from forty-two of hisspecial friends at Detroit. It emphasized the point that with hiscoming to America,  Americans had learned, what they hadforgotten for long, that they and Indians belonged to a common,Aryan, race and felt in their hearts that they were one. What,however, gladdened the Swami most was to receive a copy of1251an address of welcome given to Swami Saradananda by thestudents of the Vedanta Society of New York on 15 Januarylast. It told him that his dear gurubhai had been a success andthat, consequently, despite his own absence, the great work ofspreading the teachings of Vedanta in America was continuing.On the occasion of the presentation of the address, Dr. E. G.Day had said that Swami Vivekananda\u2019s mantle had fallen onworthy shoulders and that they were ready to extend to him(Swami Saradananda) the love and loyalty they had for hispredecessor (Swami Vivekananda).VIIISunday, 28 February 1897, was the day fixed by the ReceptionCommittee for giving an official public reception to SwamiVivekananda. Wanting to avoid a repetition of the disorder thathad somewhat marred the reception given to the Swami on hisarrival in Calcutta, they had adopted certain measures that werecalculated to make the function a dignified and orderly one.Admission to the meeting was restricted to holders of tickets,which were issued free and only to so many as could beaccommodated in the spacious natmandir of the residence ofthe late Raja Sir Radhakanta Deb Bahadur at Sobha Bazar,where it was held. Nevertheless, four thousand people, \u201cmostlymiddleclass Hindus, not schoolboys,\u201d assembled on theoccasion to give the whilom Narendra Nath Datta but nowfamous Swami Vivekananda a rousing welcome. The Maharajaof Darbhanga having backed out, the chair was occupied byRaja Benoy Krishna Deb Bahadur and among those present onthe dais were noticed the Hon\u2019ble Justice Chandra MadhabGhosh, Maharaja Jagadindra Nath Roy of Natore, RajasRajendra Narayan Deb Bhadur and  Peary Mohan Mukherjee,A CIVIC RECEPTIONSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1252several Kumars of the Deb family, S. N. Tagore (son of KaliKrishna Tagore), and Gogonendra Nath Tagore, along withRabindranath Tagore 87 and several other scions of the Tagorefamily, Dr. R. G. Kar, Suresh Chandra Samajpati, Prosad DassBoral, Pandit Ramendra Nath Bidyanidhi, among others.(Conspicuous among the absentees, it would seem, were someof the famous pandits \u2014 Mahamahopadhyayas and others \u2014who had mustered strong in the meeting held in the Town Hallthree years back to congratulate the Swami on his success inthe Parliament of Religions.) The meeting was absolutelyorderly, everyone present being fully conscious of the solemnityof the occasion and full of genuine love and respect for theSwami and, as a fellow Bengali, feeling proud of him.Raja Benoy Krishna read the welcome address, prefacingit by a few well-chosen words of his own. The very first wordsof the address, \u201cDear Brother\u201d, which echoed in and silentlyrang out of every heart in the vast hall, struck the keynote. TheSwami was no longer \u201cHis Most Holiness SwamiVivekananda\u201d, but their boy, Naren, come back to his ownpeople, after winning laurels for himself as well as for them.The Swami\u2019s reply which, according to his intimate associates,was not in his best form (he being, as we have seen, on theverge of a breakdown in health), was still a masterly one andconceived in the spirit of utmost modesty. His very first wordswere to express his thanks for their use of the \u201cunique\u201d word,\u201cBrother\u201d, in their address for, said he, he stood before themnot as the Sannyasin, not even as a preacher, but as the oldCalcutta boy. Referring to the Parliament of Religions he saidthat it gave him an opportunity to commence his career in theWest. (\u201cMy mission to America,\u201d said he, \u201cwas not to theParliament of Religions. That was only something by the way,it was only an opening, an opportunity.\u201d) The Parliament was1253meant to be a Christian show. The American people, however,treated him well and he was grateful to them, said he. A moresubstantial work, however, was done in England, he added.He paid a handsome tribute to the English people. They had,said he, a rough exterior with a very fine heart within; if oncean idea was made to enter into their brain, it was sure to takeroot there and the English would be sure to carry it out. (\u201cNoone ever landed on English soil with more hatred in his heartfor a race than I did for the English. . . . , but the more I livedamong them. . the more I loved them.\u201d \u201cThey are a nation ofheroes, they are true Kshatriyas.\u201d) The English had given themmany things and he would urge his countrymen to give themsomething in return, which was the treasure they had inheritedfrom their ancestors. (Once again we would warn the readeragainst thinking that he had turned a blind eye at the faults ofthe English. In a letter to Miss Margaret Noble, dated 29 July1897, he told her that Indians \u201cshunned the white skin\u201d andwere \u201chated by them intensely.\u201d What he thought of Britishrule in India was stated clearly in his letter to Mary Hale, dated30 October 1899, which we have commented on in an earlierChapter.)The Swami next spoke about his Master,Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, his hero, his ideal, his God inlife. In words which were as earnest as they were felicitousand which, though sounding new to the ears of people inCalcutta, among whom were many who criticized him for notspeaking enough about his Master, had been uttered by him anumber of times in the West and the latest in Madras, heexpressed his uncompromising reverence for him. The wordsmay appear to be extravagant to some of us today, but theywere very apt and, one may say, very timely, and they disarmedevery hostility. We have quoted them a number of times, butADDRESS AT  CIVIC RECEPTIONSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1254they bear repetition, \u201cIf there has been anything achieved byme, by thoughts or words or deeds,  if from my lips ever hasfallen one word that has helped anyone in the world, it was his.But if there have been curses falling from my lips, if there hasbeen hatred coming out of me, it is all mine, and not his. Allthat has been weak has been mine, and all that has been life-giving, strengthening, pure and holy, has been his inspiration,his words and he himself.\u201d He spoke about the power that hadcome out of his Master\u2019s advent, which within ten years of hispassing away had encircled the globe, and more wonderfulmanifestations of which would be seen before this generationpassed away. \u201cWe must conquer the world, or die. There is noother alternative,\u201d said he. He hit off the weaknesses of themodern Hindus with the words, \u201cOne of the great causes ofIndia\u2019s misery and downfall was that she narrowed herself,went into her shell as the oyster does and refused to give of herjewels and treasures to other races of mankind, refused to givethe life-giving truths to thirsting nations outside the Aryan fold.That has been the one great cause, and that we did not go out,that we did not compare notes with other nations, has been theone great cause of our downfall.\u201dThe shackles that have been weighing us down, saidSwami Vivekananda, have been of our own forging and if wedo not break them none else may. He asked them to know theirlatent strength and to become strong. We must conquer theworld, not by force of physical arms, but by spiritual forces,which are irresistible. Swami Vivekananda closed his addresswith a fervent appeal to the people of Bengal, specially theyouth of the province, \u201cI have done nothing as yet; you have todo the task. . . . . I have travelled for the last ten years or soover the whole of India, and my conviction is that from theyouth of Bengal will come the power which will raise India1255once more to her proper spiritual place.  .  . Awake, arise andstop not till the desired end is reached.\u201d Whether or not theSwami\u2019s faith in his own people and specially the youth wasjustified and what was the response of his impassioned appealto them, are questions which we cannot attempt to answer justnow. That it could not go in vain was what could be expected,and is all that we must stop with saying for the present. Itsimmediate effects were favourable, as press comments indicate.The Indian Mirror wrote on 4 March 1897, \u201cWe have to expressnothing but admiration for the great speech, delivered by SwamiVivekananda in reply to the address presented to him by theHindu community of Calcutta and other parts of Bengal, onSunday last. And our criticism ought to begin and end withthat single word `admiration\u2019. Two features of that magnificentspeech are specially noteworthy, viz., its extreme fervour andits extreme modesty. We miss, and agreeably miss, the powerfulself-assertion \u2014 one might not inaptly style it pugilism \u2014which so largely marred the effect of his otherwise thoughtfuland original deliverances in Madras. . . .\u201d The Calcuttacorrespondent of The Hindu of Madras reported, inter alia , asfollows, \u201cWe are still passing in Calcutta through what I maycall the Vivekananda week. I told you last week that orthodoxBengal had already begun to look upon Vivekananda withconsiderable distrust. The heterodox also, I should have added,commenced to criticise his Madras utterances ratherunfavourably. . But whatever may have been the feeling ofdistrust or opposition before Vivekananda\u2019s public appearanceat Raja Sir Radhakanta\u2019s house on Sunday last, the candourand humility which, unlike his Madras speeches, characterizedhis first Calcutta speech dispelled the distrust and disarmedthe opposition of many people. . . .\u201d 88ADDRESS AT  CIVIC RECEPTIONSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1256Within a few days of this public reception \u2014 on Thursday,4 March 1897 \u2014 the Swami appeared once more before theCalcutta public to deliver a lecture, \u201cThe Vedanta in all itsphases\u201d. He was rather unwilling to deliver more lectures onreligion, because his mind was getting preoccupied with thequestion of the appalling poverty of his people \u2014 at the time afamine was also raging \u2014 and Sri Ramakrishna\u2019s words wereoccurring to his mind incessantly, \u201cOne cannot think of religionin an empty stomach.\u201d However, he persuaded himself to thinkthat it was imperative that the people should know what theirreligion truly was, and in view of criticisms that Vedanta, whichhe preached, was not the whole of Hinduism, to explain itsuniversalism and his own position in the matter. The lecturewas delivered at the Star Theatre and the admission was byticket (Box \u2014 Rs. 2, Stall and Pit \u2014 Re. 1, and Gallery \u20148 annas). A select and respectable audience filled the hall andthe lecture, which lasted for full one and a half hours, waslistened to with rapt attention. The lecture was one of thosemasterpieces of philosophical dissertation which he had voicedall his way from Colombo. Mr. Narendra Nath Sen took thechair, and the following gentlemen, among others, were present:the Hon\u2019ble Justice Gurudas Banerji, Hon\u2019ble Rai P. AnandaCharlu Bahadur, Hon\u2019ble A. M. Bose, Raja Benoy KrishnaBahadur, Nilmani Nyayalankar (Principal, Sanskrit College),Mr. T. G. Harrison, Dr. C. Turnbull.The very first words of the lecture stirred up the mindsof his hearers: \u201cAway back, where no recorded history, nay,not even the dim light of tradition, can penetrate, has beensteadily shining the light, sometimes dimmed by externalcircumstances, at other effulgent, but undying and steady,shedding its luster not only over India, but permeating the wholethought world with its power, silent, unperceived, gentle, yet1257omnipotent, like the dew that falls in the morning, unseen andunnoticed, yet bringing into bloom the fairest of roses \u2014 thishas been the thought of the Upanishads, the philosophy of theVedanta.\u201d He then said that Vedanta had been the first as wellas the final thought on the spiritual plane that had ever beenvouchsafed to man. From thence light was borne westwards,and gave its impetus to the minds of the Greeks, showing thatthe Vedantic system clearly must have made its mark on theminds of the ancient Greeks. India, too, in spite of all the jarringsects that they saw now, had the Vedantic system as the basisof all the sects. Whether one was a dualist, a qualified monist,or a monist, or whatever else one called oneself, there stoodbehind them as their authority the Upanishads. Whatever systemin India did not obey the Upanishads could not be calledorthodox. Thus Vedantism, whether they knew it or not, hadpenetrated all the sects of India, and what they called Hinduism,with its immense, almost infinite ramification, had beenpenetrated by the influence of Vedantism. Whether they wereconscious of it or not, they thought the Vedanta, they lived inthe Vedanta, they breathed the Vedanta, and they died in theVedanta. The people who called themselves Hindus had betterbe called Vedantists.Taking his stand on the unassailable ground that the Vedasand Upanishads are the basis of all systems of philosophy, orreligion in India, Swami Vivekananda touched alternately onthe Snaky, Yoga, and Ramanuja systems, and showed them allas classifications of the Vedanta. He gave his audience someidea of the marvellous beauty of the poetry of the Samhitasand the Upanishads, quoting some passages from them, e.g., tatra tama asittamaso gurham (where darkness was hidden indarkness) in the Samhita which described Chaos; yato vachonivartante aprapya manasa saha (from whence words comeVEDANTA IN ALL ITS PHASESSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1258back reflected together with the mind), na tatrachakshurgachchhati na vaggachchhati (there the eye cannotgo, nor can speech reach), etc., in the Upanishads, that declarethe utter helplessness of  the senses to find the solution of thegreat problems of life and death in the external world. He dwelton the impersonal character of the Upanishads. These are ourscriptures, he declared: what the Bible is to the Christians, theQuran to the Muhammadans, the Tripitaka to the Buddhists,the Zend Avesta to the Parsis, these Upanishads are to us. \u201cTheseand nothing but these are our scriptures.\u201d He next dwelt onsome of the great teachings of the Upanishads. He exalted theidea of renunciation even to the extreme of asceticism as acounterbalance to the influx of purely materialistic ideals fromthe West. He denounced all forms of hypocrisy and fanaticismpractised in the name of religion and orthodoxy. By drawing acontrast between the degenerating influence of the Vamacharapractice of the Tantras and the strengthening and ennoblinginfluence of the Upanishads, he still further intensified the needof exalting the Vedanta per se , above all other systems. Thisspirit permeated his entire discourse. 89The speech made a profound impression on all classesof the thinking people in the province. In its issue of Monday,8 March 1897, The Indian Nation commented on it as follows:\u201cThe lecture on Vedantism was one of great power and beauty.Possibly it is the best of all the lectures that he has deliveredanywhere. It was rich in suggestion, and replete withinstructions.\u201d 90 Swami Vivekananda\u2019s command of the Englishlanguage, his masterly eloquence and his profound knowledgeof the sastras and the philosophical systems of the East and theWest were now known to everybody. It helped Hindus tounderstand the essentials of their religion as distinguished fromdesacharas (local usages). They now recognized the Swami as1259the embodiment and true exponent of the Hindu Dharma in itswidest sense. Some of the misconceptions that had been createdin the public mind by hostile propaganda, such as the Swami\u2019salleged lapses  in the West, were also removed as it wasunderstood that that he was a Hindu of Hindus, true to the faithof his ancestors. The reaction among the circles that wereopposed to the Swami was diverse. Articles criticizing theSwami continued to appear in the press, while his old \u201cfriends,\u201dsuch as Pratap Chandra Majumdar, began a renewed campaignagainst him. Many orthodox Pandits in tols all over the countrycontinued to belittle him and raised once again the old question,viz., by what right, he, a Sudra, could accept sannyasa , orbecome a religious leader. Many others, however, wereimpressed with his profound scholarship in Sanskrit andmastery of the sastras, and even felt that he was unassailablewhen he exposed some of their social and religious vagaries asinconsistent with sastric injunctions.The next time when Swami Vivekananda made a publicappearance was three days later (7 March 1897) on the occasionof the birthday anniversary of Sri Ramakrishna, which wasbeing held with great eclat at Dakshineswar during the lastfew years. An exceptionally large crowd had this time gatheredthere as it was known that Swamiji was to take part in thefestival. He arrived there at about 9 o\u2019clock accompanied bysome of his gurubhais. He was dressed in a long Alkhilla witha yellow turban on his head, and was barefooted. Vast crowdseager to see him and take the dust of his feet thronged abouthim and followed him wherever he went. After a while he wentto the temple of the Mother, and bowed his head before theimage, while thousands that thronged about him did likewise.Then, after prostrating himself before Radhakantaji, he cameinto the room which Sri Ramakrishna used to occupy and whichVEDANTA IN ALL ITS PHASESSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1260was full of devotees. Next, in company with his Europeandisciples, who had just then come, he walked towardsPanchavati, reading a hymn handed to him by his disciple, SaratChandra Chakravarti, who had composed it. He showed to themthe places rendered sacred by their association withSri Ramakrishna\u2019s sadhanas. Shouts of \u201cJay Ramakrishna\u201dechoed and reechoed from one corner of the temple ground toanother, and sankirtan parties were found singing and dancingin the name of the Lord everywhere.Around Panchavati, some householder disciples of theMaster happened to be assembled, among whom was BabuGirish Chandra Ghosh. Swamiji greeted Girish Babu, saying,\u201cHallo, here is Ghoshaja (Mr. Ghosh),\u201d and had a few minutes\u2019talk with him. He commented to his friend on the presentoccasion, contrasting it with the early days when the birthdayof the Master was celebrated by only a few people, mostly hisdisciples. \u201cWhat a difference, Ghoshaja.\u201d Said the Swami,\u201cbetween those days and these.\u201d \u201cI know that, but still thererises the desire to see more,\u201d replied Girish Babu, in the wordsof a passage from the Ramayana in which Nikasha, the motherof Ravana explained her desire to live longer still even afterthe worst had happened, because she wanted to witness greaterand greater glories of the Divine Lila . Somewhat in the samespirit, the thousands who had come to participate in thecelebrations and had their hearts\u2019 desire satisfied by seeingSwamiji, wanted to have more. They went on requesting thathe may say a few words on the occasion. In spite of his poorhealth and the strain and fatigue of the day, Swami Vivekanandaattempted to address them. But, as in Madras on the occasionof his public reception, he found that, however loudly he spoke,his voice did not reach far enough.91 He therefore desisted fromthe attempt and instead, moved about as much among the crowd1261as was feasible. He mingled freely among the people,exchanged friendly greetings, and occasionally introduced hisEnglish friends whenever he came across some disciples ofthe Master whom he knew. At about 3 p.m. he left for theAlambazar Math, accompanied by  Swami Niranjanananda andSarat Chandra Chakravarti in a thika garhi hired for the journeyat 2 annas only. On the way he talked to them on the significanceof Hindu religious festivals, observing that they infused thegreat religious ideals into the minds of the masses. The disciple(Sarat Chandra Chakravarti) protested mildly that bycelebrating such festivals as of that day he might be inauguratinganother sect round the name of Sri Ramakrishna. Swamijiturned to Swami Niranjanananda in evident amusement andsaid, \u201cJust think what this Bangal is saying!\u201d He then told hisdisciple, \u201cIt is only the pure Upanishadic religion that I havegone about preaching in the world.\u201d (See C.W ., cited, VI, 470.)Swami Vivekananda had intended to deliver one morelecture in Calcutta after returning from Darjeeling, the proposedsubject being, \u201cExperiences of the West.\u201d 92 He could not doso, without doubt for the reason that he had many otherengagements to keep him busy, while his health wasdeteriorating day by day. As a matter of fact, Swamiji was notto deliver a single more lecture in Calcutta, whatever may havebeen the reasons for this (see Chapter 13, Section V below)though on a number of occasions he was present at some publicfunctions and spoke a few words, e.g., on 11 March 1898 at ameeting at the Star Theatre introducing Miss Noble to heraudience, or on 18 March 1898 at the Emerald Theatreintroducing Swami Saradananda to the audience. In the midstof all his worries and engagements, however, there was, as hetold Mary Hale in a letter dated 9 July 1897, 93 \u201conly one idea\u201d,that was \u201cburning in his brain\u201d, viz., \u201cto start the machine forTHE SWAMI AT DAKSHINESWARSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1262elevating the Indian masses.\u201d The immediate plan was to setup two centers, one in Calcutta and the other in Madras, and itwas a matter for great satisfaction to him that before he left forDarjeeling he succeeded in sending Swami Ramakrishnanandato Madras, thereby also  keeping his promise to his disciples atthat place that he would send them one who could be a fitrepresentative of himself. (He had told his Madrasi disciplesthat he would send a gurubhai who was more orthodox thanthe most orthodox among them and, withal, unmatched inworship, knowledge of the sastras, meditation, etc.) The storyis told that, soon after reaching Calcutta, he wanted to testSwami Ramakrishnananda a little, knowing fully well howunwilling he was to leave the shrine room even for a day, as towhether he would be ready to leave for Madras as he wished.He drew him aside one day and said, \u201cSasi, you love me verydearly, do you not?\u201d As soon as Sasi said, \u201cYes.\u201d Swamiji toldhim, \u201cThen, go immediately to Faujdari Balakhana at Chitpurcrossing, purchase and bring for me a nice, freshly baked, softloaf.\u201d The shop was owned by Muslims and loaves made there(if not all loaves) were abhorred by orthodox Hindus, whileSasi was one of the most orthodox among his gurubhais. ButSasi immediately started for the place (about 5 or 6 miles fromAlambazar Math), and on reaching it purchased a loaf fromthe shop in broad daylight and with it in his hand walked backto the Math. Thereupon, Swamiji said, \u201c Bhai , you have to goto Madras,\u201d and without one more word, Sasi agreed. In thelast week of March, accompanied by Swami Saradananda,Swami Ramakrishnananda reached Madras by sea. 94 On 20March 1897, Swamiji wrote a letter to him at Madras fromDarjeeling, giving him some advice about how to carry on hiswork there. 95 Announcing his arrival at Madras in the previousweek The Madras Standard said on 5 April 1897 that his planwas to open three classes in different centers of the city, one at1263Triplicane, one at Mylapore and another at Black Town forimparting regular instruction in the Gita, Upanishads andVedanta.96His mind at ease at the thought that one important taskhad been done, Swamiji left for Darjeeling on 8 March 1897seeking for the rest both in body and mind that he had beenlong feeling he badly needed and the physicians insisted upon.97 He came on a flying visit to Calcutta on 21 March 1897(which means that he left Darjeeling on 20 March, after he hadbeen there for twelve days only ), having received theinformation that his dear friend and disciple, the Maharaja ofKhetri, had come to the city all the way from Rajputana just tomeet him. We do not know how long he stayed in Calcutta thistime, but he must have returned to Darjeeling on or before 6April 1897, judging from the fact that he wrote a letter fromthere on that day. It may be presumed, however, that since theMaharaja of Khetri left Calcutta on 26 March, Swamiji tooleft for Darjeeling a day or two later, latest, 28 March. Thismay mean that he stayed in Calcutta this time for about a weekand consequently that, since we know that he returned fromDarjeeling to Calcutta on Wednesday, 28 April, 98 his stay forthe second time in that health resort could not have been formore than a month at the most. A month\u2019s stay at Darjeeling,\u201cthe queen of hill stations,\u201d is, however, generally consideredto be good enough for a health seeker.At Darjeeling Swami Vivekananda was joined by SwamisBrahmananda, Trigunatita, and Jnanananda, Babu GirishChandra Ghosh, Mr. Goodwin, Dr. Turnbull and his Madrasidisciples, viz., Alasinga, Kidi and Narasimhacharya, who eitheraccompanied him at the time, or else followed him in a fewdays. Mrs. and Mr. Sevier had already reached the place. Duringtheir stay at Darjeeling they were all the guests of Mr. andTHE SWAMI AT DARJEELINGSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1264Mrs. Banerjee, who lavished their hospitality on them. TheMaharaja of Burdwan, who revered Swamiji, also placed aportion of his residence known as \u201cRose Bank\u201d at the disposalof the Swami for some time. Though it was impossible for himto shake off all his cares, as some of the letters he wrote duringthese days clearly  show, the Swami did try to abide by theregimen of rest and diet prescribed by the physicians. From aletter that he wrote to Mary Hale from Darjeeling on 28 April1897 (the day he left Darjeeling) we learn something about hislife there. He was made to live upon meat and meat alone,forgoing altogether even a little bread, or rice, or potatoes, or alump of sugar in his coffee. (These dietic restrictions evidentlyindicate that his present disease had been diagnosed as diabeteswhich, before the discovery of insulin treatment, caused earlydeaths. His, however, was a peculiar case because at times hefelt quite well and then again would experience a violentreaction.) He was walking and riding a lot and enjoying thenatural beauty of Darjeeling and the surroundings. He wrotethat the local people, the Tibetans and Nepalese and, aboveall, the beautiful Lepcha women were very picturesque. Fromthis letter, however, we gather that, so far as the most importantthing was concerned, viz., his health, there was no improvementin it yet and that possibly it was continuing to deteriorate. Hewrote, \u201cMy hair is turning grey in bundles, and my face isgetting wrinkled up all over; that losing of flesh has given metwenty years of age more. And now I am losing flesh rapidly..\u201d Not liking his dear \u201csister\u201d to be too much worried abouthim, he ended his letter on an optimistic note and with a littlemerriment. He said, \u201cI am very well here, for life in the plainshas become a torture. . I am going to train a big beard; now itis turning grey. It gives a venerable appearance and saves onefrom American scandalmongers! O thou white hair, how muchthou canst conceal, all glory unto thee, Hallelujah!\u201d 991265The Swami\u2019s health, however, did improve after theabove letter was written and some of the distressing symptomsdisappeared, though we are unable to say exactly when thedisease was brought under control. As we learn from a letterdated 3 June 1897, that the Swami wrote to an Americandisciple from Almora, he, like Phoenix, was again and againbeing restored to health, and that there was nothing to worrymuch about him. He said that the disease which was the resultof overexertion had nearly disappeared after he had taken rest.He said that he had been almost completely cured of his diseasewhile he was at Darjeeling and that, though he was occasionallysuffering from indigestion now at Almora, he was otherwisewell and was trying to cure himself of the ailments by followingChristian Science methods. It was by mental treatment alone,he remarked, that he had got rid of his illness at Darjeeling.The greying of the hairs, however, continued for some time.On 25 July 1897, Swamiji wrote to Marie Halboister, \u201cBy theway, I am glad to find that I am aging fast, my hair is turninggrey. `Silver threads among the gold\u2019 \u2014 I mean black \u2014 arecoming in fast.\u201d 100 On 28 August 1897 he wrote to Mary Hale,\u201cBy the by, I am glad now that I am growing grey every day.My head will be a full-blown white lotus by the time you seeme next.\u201d 101 Much of all this that he was writing about his hairmight have been mere fun, for in September 1899, while hewas staying at Ridgely Manor and was expecting to go toChicago soon and meet his \u201csisters,\u201d he wrote to Mary Hale,giving a somewhat different story about it. \u201cI was growing greyfast,\u201d said he, \u201cbut somehow it got checked. I am sorry, only afew grey hairs now; a research will unearth many though. Ilike it and am going to cultivate a long white goatee.\u201d 102As we have said above, after Swami Vivekananda hadbeen at Darjeeling for only a little more than a week he receivedTHE SWAMI AT DARJEELINGSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1266the information that the Maharaja of Khetri had arrived inCalcutta to see him. The latter had sent Munshi Jagmohan Lalto Madras with an address of welcome from him which, as wehave seen, was read out at the meeting held at Victoria Hall togive him a  public reception. The Khetri ruler was naturallyanxious to meet his guru on his return to India after a longabsence in the West, and he must have worried much abouthim on the score of his health from what Jagmohan Lal musthave told him about it. He reached Calcutta on 18 March 1897without, it would seem, knowing that Swamiji had already leftfor Darjeeling. He was received with great honour at Howrahstation by many people including the merchants of Khetriresiding at Calcutta who were headed by Dulichand Kankarnia,Swamis Trigunatitananda, Sivananda and a few others. TheSwamis blessed the Maharaja in true oriental fashion bypresenting him with coconut, paddy and durva grass. 103 Hewas then lodged in a four storeyed building belonging toShewbuxji Bogla, who had participated in the Town Hallmeeting in 1894 to congratulate the Swami as also in theSobhabazar Rajbati meeting a few days back. On the day whenSwamiji arrived in Calcutta from Darjeeling, viz., Sunday, 21March 1897, the Maharaja sent two persons to Barrackpore toreceive him in advance there, and himself went to the Sealdahstation at 10 a.m. Long before the due time for the arrival ofthe Darjeeling Mail (10.45. a.m), by which the Swami wascoming, the station platform was packed to suffocation, thoughthe arrival was private. The vast crowd of people that hadassembled to receive the Swami was composed mostly ofMarwaris and in fact, as The Indian Mirror reported, the wholeBurra Bazar community was there with all its leading men.After the train had come to a stop at the platform, the Maharajawent into the first-class compartment in which the Swami wastravelling and prostrated himself before him. He then washed1267the Swami\u2019s feet, offered flowers and other Puja articles onthem and garlanded him. He also garlanded the other Swamiswho accompanied the Swami. After the Swami had emergedfrom his compartment, he was introduced to the Nawab Sahebof Loharu and some prominent Marwari gentlemen who hadgathered at the station to have the Swami\u2019s darshan . TheMaharaja then read a welcome address in Hindi and presentedit to the Swami. After this Swamiji was taken to the splendidcarriage of the Maharaja which was waiting outside. From thisplace, a big procession, consisting of nearly 200 carriages, droveto the Bogla residence. After reaching there, the Swami had abath and then went to the Durbar, which was being held by theMaharaja. He took his seat by the side of the Maharaja,whereupon the latter stood up and offered him nazar (customarypresent of a gold coin), and then took his seat on the carpetalong with other people. According to the directions of theMaharaja, the Seths and Mahajans assembled there offerednazar to the Swami. 104In the evening 105 Swami Vivekananda and the Maharaja,accompanied by a large party, paid a visit to the temple of Kaliat Dakshineswar which, as is well known to our readers, hadbeen the scene of Sri Ramakrishna\u2019s sadhanas and where thesaint had lived for forty years. On their arrival at the place,Swamiji and party were cordially received by BholanathMukherjee, the Khazanchi (Manager) of the temple andimmediately taken to the temple of the goddess. On the marblefloor leading to Her room, they all prostrated themselves.Bholanath Babu invited them to step inside it so that they couldhave a better view of the image. After they had done so, he hadthe western door of the room opened to let in more light, itbeing close upon 6 p.m. and getting dark. Everyone in the partywas pleased with the courtesies shown to all of them, and theBACK TO CALCUTTA-AJIT SINGHSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1268Maharaja remarked that the image of the goddess was a mostbeautiful one. As when they had arrived at the temple, so whenthey left it, a crowd had assembled and they gave the visitors ahearty sendoff. 106 From the temple, they came to the AlambazarMath, where a welcome address was presented to the Maharaja.107 The Maharaja dined there. 108 About his visit (or visits) tothe  Math, we read the following in Swami Virajanada\u2019sReminiscences, \u201cWhen the Maharaja came to Alambazar Mathto pay his respects to the Master (Sri Ramakrishna), he sat in akneeling posture before Swamiji on a mat spread on the floorof the hall and conversed with him for a long time. Plainlydressed and modest in manners, he attracted the notice ofeverybody. On the occasion, at the orders of Swamiji, a specialbhoga , which included fruits, sweetmeats and halua ( sujiporridge), was offered to the Master. Sushil (later SwamiPrakasananda) prepared the halua.\u201d 109IXIn the reception given to Swamiji at Dakshineswar, as describedabove there was a discordant note which did not reach his earsbut which became loud soon afterwards and produced anunpleasant controversy in the press. Some space has to be givento it here because, petty though it was by itself, it once againindicated that Swami Vivekananda was not having a verysmooth sailing among some sections of his own people \u2014 afact that we have already brought to the notice of the reader. Inthe account that we have given of the visit of the Swami andparty to the Kali temple, we have limited ourselves to factsrelating to it that were more or less left unchallenged in thecontroversy that arose about the reception. But there were afew other facts, capable of different interpretations, which werebrought to light in it and which, not paid much attention to at1269the time of the visit, produced important consequences later.One such fact was that Babu Trailokya Nath Biswas, theproprietor of the temple, who had been informed about theimpending visit earlier in the day, had actually come to thetemple and was present when the visit occurred but did notpersonally receive the Swami and his party, which included aprincely personage, viz., the Maharaja of Khetri. On the basisof this fact, The Bangabashi which, as we know, was a strongcritic of the Swami, alleged, in its issue of 27 March 1897, that\u201cthey were treated with scant courtesy at the hands of theproprietor.\u201d The statement was immediately challenged bysome eyewitnesses, including Mr. T. J. Harrison and Mr.Mahendra Nath Gupta who had accompanied the Swami, andtheir versions of the fact were published in The Indian Mirror,The Indian Nation, and perhaps some other English dailies. Tothese a reply was given by Babu Trailokya Nath Biswas himselfwhich was published with fanfare in The Bangabashi, whichtreated it as an effective rejoinder to its critics on the issue. Itseems that before this appeared, Bholanath Babu also had madea statement, which also had been published in The Bangabashi.The Bangabashi having been extinct long since, and no filesof its issues being found at the present day, the originals oftheir statements in Bengali are not available. But an Englishtranslation of Trailokya Babu\u2019s letter, which had appeared inThe Indian Mirror in its issue of 4 April 1897, is available.Before Trailokya Babu came out with a statement and,as we shall see, admitted that discourtesy had been shown tothe Swami, many people found it hard to believe that a grandson(daughter\u2019s son) of the illustrious Rani Rashmani and himselfwell known in respectable circles in Calcutta for his goodmanners and amiable disposition could have behaved as hewas alleged to have done. A correspondent of The Indian Mirror,AN UGLY CONTROVERSYSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1270who chose to be anonymous, considered the Bangabashistatement as \u201ca direct insult\u201d to him, and Mr. T. J. Harrison,writing in the same paper on the following day, suggested thatit was malicious, that is, prompted by a desire to malignTrailokya Babu. \u201cIt appears to me,\u201d wrote he, \u201cthat the writer,while giving to have a little fun at the expense of the visitors,is very clearly paying off a grudge he owes the proprietor byopenly exposing him in point to the public as a man devoid ofall righteous and courteous  behaviour to a stranger within hisgates.\u201d 110 Mahendra Nath Gupta also wrote to The IndianMirror , 30 May 1897, giving a strictly factual statement of theevents of the evening (on which the account we have givenabove is mainly based) without making any comments, oroffering any suggestions as the two previous writers had done.As to Trailokya Babu\u2019s role in the events of that evening, hesaid that when he (Mahendra) arrived at the temple BholanathBabu told him that, though unwell, Trailokya Babu had comeall the way to the temple to receive the visitors and was waitingfor them, but that the visitors had not turned up as yet. However,when the latter arrived, they were received by Bholanath Babu,his master having sent him word that at the time he was feelingvery unwell and was very sorry that he could not receive them.(Mahendra Babu suggested that Trailokya Babu was sufferingfrom lumbago and so, instead of coming, entrusted his menwith the duty of taking the visitors round the place.) As wehave said above, Trailokya Babu\u2019s men, headed by BholanathBabu and accompanied, as we learn from another source, 111by Trailokya Babu\u2019s sons, did the task entrusted to themadmirably and when the visitors left, everyone in themanagement felt satisfied at the part he had played in the eventsof the evening, and none among the Swamiji\u2019s party suspectedthat anything was wrong anywhere.1271To the genuine surprise of many people, or rather of allpeople except those few who wanted to lower the Swami inpublic estimation, Tailokya Babu badly let down his own menas also his defenders and apologists by writing a letter to TheBangabashi giving his own version of the affair. This waspublished in that paper on 2 April 1897. He explained hispresence at the Dakshineswar temple precincts thus. On thatday (Sunday, 9 Chaitra), said he, a disciple and a European(Mr. Harrison) belonging to the Math turned up at his residenceat about 11 a.m.  and asked for an interview with him. Herefused to see them, whereupon they told his durwan that theMaharaja of Jaipur accompanied by Swami Vivekananda wereto visit the temple in the afternoon and that it was desirablethat he should receive them personally there. He doubtedwhether it was the Maharaja of Jaipur who was visiting thetemple, because in that case the Resident would have informedhim about it. Nevertheless, as his sons were anxious to see theMaharaja of Jaipur, he went to Dakshineswar, he said. For whattranspired there he referred to the account given \u201capproximatelyaccurately\u201d by Bholanath Babu which was published in thepaper ( The Bangabashi ) on 15 Chaitra (27 March 1897). Aswe have said above, we have not got this letter, but can guesshow it went from what Trailokya Babu says about it. Therelevant lines which clearly indicate that Bholanath Babu hadhad a volteface and also give us an idea of Trailokya Babu\u2019smentality, are worth quoting. \u201cIn an indirect way,\u201d saidTrailokya Babu, \u201cthe Swami and his followers were drivenaway from the temple, but not in a direct way as stated byBabu Bholanath. I never ordered anyone to welcome the Swamiand the Raja nor did I myself do it. I thought that I should nothave any, the least, intercourse with a man, who went to aforeign country and yet calls himself a Hindu. While SwamiVivekananda and his followers were leaving my temple, BabuAN UGLY CONTROVERSYSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1272Bholanath Mukherjee told them that they would have nointerview with me. . . . Your account of the reabhisheka of theidol is perfectly true.\u201d 112No comments on this statement are needed today for,read along with the other statements that we have given above,an assessment will not be found difficult. The good MasterMahasaya (Mahendra Nath Gupta) argued still (in a letter toThe Indian Mirror dated 2 April 1897) that the conduct ofBholanath Babu and his men on that evening had beenexemplary. He even found in Trailokya Babu\u2019s letter anassurance from him that \u201cthe alleged rudeness to the Swamiwas not a fact.\u201d A member of the family of Rani Rashmaniprotested (in a letter which was published in The Indian Nationof 12 April 1897) against Trailokya Babu\u2019s claim that the templeof Kali at Dakshineswar belonged to himself. He (ChundyChurn Chowdhry) asserted that it belonged as much to him asto any other descendant of the late Rani Rashmani and that therecent scandal would not have taken place had it been underthe management of any other member of the family. 113Notwithstanding these well-meant efforts to ease the situation,the story of Swamiji\u2019s alleged expulsion from the Kali templegained ground. While The Bangabashi and other Bengalinewspapers who opposed Swamiji kept it alive by continuallywriting on it, his old \u201cfriends\u201d, the Christian missionaries, andeven perhaps Pratap Chandra Majumdar, had a new dart intheir quiver for attacking him. Dr. Barrows who, as we know,had lately arrived in India and had turned against Swamiji,accusing him of vilifying American women, etc., took it asone more proof of the correctness of his theory that Swamijiwas not a true Hindu and had not preached Hinduism inAmerica. On the very evening of his landing in California afterhis sojourn in India, 20 May 1897, he vented his spleen before1273a reporter of The Chronicle . Said he, inter alia , \u201cThe Swamiarrived in Madras one week ahead of me, . . . . but . . . . hehurriedly left Madras on the day I arrived. All that The Chroniclecredited him with saying about American women is true, andknowing that he had been telling lies he avoided me. There isone thing I want to correct however. The Swami has not lostcaste through his conduct. It transpires that he never was aBrahman. He belongs to the Sudra caste, the lowest of therespectable castes in India. All that he said against Americanwomen and institutions disgusted some of the Hindus I met.They came to me and declared that he did not represent orpreach their faith.\u201d 114When The Bangabashi article was published (27 March1897), Swami Vivekananda had possibly already left forDarjeeling, and in any case it was not till sometime later thathe came to hear about it and about the missionary propagandaagainst him. It was never his practice to enter into a publiccontroversy, specially for self-defense. Thus, though we maybe sure that he felt the attacks deeply, it was not till sometimeafterwards that he expressed himself on them, \u2014 that too beingin private letters to his loving sister Mary Hale. TrailokyaBabu\u2019s attitude to him could not be ignored for, as we shallsoon see, he created further troubles for him by forbidding himto enter the temple precincts at the next celebration ofSri Ramakrishna\u2019s birthday there in 1898. We shall speak aboutthe developments later, but so far as the mentality displayedby Trailokya Babu in his letter was concerned, we may be surethat it did not greatly surprise him. (It is quite likely that evenon that evening it did not escape his notice that there wassomething fishy about Trailokya Babu\u2019s behaviour.) He knewthe man, and surely had heard stories of how he had behavedtowards even Sri Ramakrishna. Mahendra Gupta tells us 115AN UGLY CONTROVERSYSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1274that Trailokya Babu disliked the saint\u2019s paying visits to KeshubChandra Sen and partaking of refreshments offered to him byKeshub. Sri Ramakrishna used to tell Keshub \u201cO Keshub, if Itake your sweetmeats, Trailokya will not allow me to enter MaKali\u2019s temple and touch her feet.\u201d We read in Life ofSri Ramakrishna 116 that once Trailokya had gone to the lengthof ordering the saint out of the temple garden for an offencecommitted by his nephew, Hriday. He first passed an orderthat Hriday should leave, and after the latter had left also thathe too should leave. As the saint was walking out of the gate,Trailokya had him called back. It seems that, even for some time after he had heardabout the row kicked up against him by the orthodox people,Swami Vivekananda took little notice of it. His attitude waseven one of defiance of these critics, as we find it expressed inhis letter to his old friend, Pramadadas Mitra, with whom, aswe have stated in an earlier Chapter, he had parted companylong ago, one of the reasons being the latter\u2019s orthodoxy. Inthe course of this letter \u2014 incidentally his last letter to PramadaBabu \u2014 dated 30 May 1897, he wrote, \u201cOur books tell us thatthe practice of religion is not for a Sudra; if he discriminatesabout food, or refrains from foreign travel, it avails him nothingand it is all useless toil for him. I am a Sudra and a Mlechchha\u2014 why should I worry about observance of these rules? Whatmatters it to me if I take the foods of the Mlechchhas and theuntouchables of Hindu society?\u201d 117 A few months later, whenhe came to know about the propaganda that was being carriedon by Dr. Barrows and the missionaries to the effect that hehad slandered American women and also that he had been outcasted in India, he wrote on the latter point to Mary Hale on 9July 1897 as follows, \u201cAs if I had any caste to lose, being asannyasin!\u201d 118 He added, \u201cNot only no caste had been lost, but1275it has considerably shattered the opposition to sea voyage \u2014my going to the West. . . On the other hand, a leading Raja ofthe caste I belonged to before entering the order got up a banquetin my honour, at which were most of the big bugs of that caste. .It will suffice to say that the police were necessary to keeporder if I ventured out into the street! That is out castingindeed!\u201dHowever, Trailokya Babu\u2019s order forbidding him to enterthe Kali temple caused him considerable worry, forDakshineswar, with its memories of Sri Ramakrishna\u2019ssadhanas and residence, was the most suitable place where hisbirthday anniversary could be held. On 15 November 1897, hewrote to Indumati  Mitra on the vexed subject as follows, \u201cIt isimpossible to celebrate Sri Ramakrishna\u2019s festival this year forthe proprietors of Rashmani\u2019s garden would not let me go thereas I am returned from the West.\u201d119 He had spoken of the subjectas an impossibility because his expulsion from Dakshineswarhad placed him on the horns of a dilemma, both of which wereequally forbidding and between which no safe way could bediscerned. To find out another place where the festival couldbe held was a difficult task, and if this course was followedthere was the danger that many disciples of Sri Ramakrishna,and specially some of the leading householder disciples, mightdisapprove it. Undaunted by the prospect of a further wideningof the breach between householder and the sannyasi disciplesof the Master, Swami Vivekananda decided to intensify hisefforts for securing a plot of land for the Math, and to hold thecelebration there. On 30 November 1897, he wrote to SwamiBrahmananda from Delhi as follows, \u201cWe must hold theMahotsava (big festival) on our own plot of ground \u2014remember this must be your first and foremost work, comewhat may.\u201d 120 Actually, with Rs. 39,000/ contributed byAN UGLY CONTROVERSYSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1276Miss Muller, a large plot of land was purchased at Belur forthe Math\u2019s headquarters. But though the earnest money waspaid on 3 February 1898, possession could not be obtainedbefore the next tithipuja day which fell on 22 February 1898.Accordingly, this ceremony was performed on due date at therented Math buildings at Belur, which were situated a little tothe north of the new plot. The public celebration (includingthe Mahotsava ) was held at a plot which was further to thenorth and belonged to one Purna Chandra Daw, from whomthe necessary permission was obtained. In the following yearthe celebration was held at the Math\u2019s own headquarters atBelur, but some householder disciples of Sri Ramakrishna,including Haramohan Babu and Girindra Babu, did not attendit and had their own celebration elsewhere. 121The celebration has been held year by year at Belur Mathwith great eclat ever since.As we have said above, the furore raised by certainsections of his countrymen in Bengal against his ideas andprogramme of work indicated that Swami Vivekananda didnot have an easy time with them. But, though heavily committedand in poor health, he persevered \u2014 answering his critics notonly by his speeches and writings but by actually practisingwhat he preached, viz. sivajnane jivapuja (worship throughservice), by the role he played in fighting plague and famine.With reference to the work conducted by his disciples andgurubhais in this connection, Swami Vivekananda wrote toSwami Brahmananda on 13 July 1897 as follows: \u201cAll suchwork is real work. If the field is made ready in this way, theseeds of spiritual knowledge can be sown. Remember thisalways \u2014 that the only answer to those conservative fanaticswho abuse us, is such work.\u201d 122 This is not the place to judge1277how far Swami Vivekananda was able to influence hiscountrymen of Bengal at this time, but it is important to bearin mind the fact that these fanatics were not the whole of theBengalis who counted. Some of the best minds of the provincehastened to acclaim him and assure him of their approval andsupport. In an article contributed to the Tattvabodhini Patrikafor Chaitra, 1303, B. S. and entitled, \u201cUpanishad O SwamiVivekananda\u201d, Sri Jyotirindranath Tagore (an elder brother ofRabindranath Tagore) gave what he called the gist and essenceof the teachings of Swami Vivekananda in his lecture at theStar Theatre. He contended that in proclaiming before hiscountrymen the truths contained in the Upanishads, the Swamicame in the line of great reformers beginning with Raja RamMohan Roy, and as such could not be sufficiently thanked. Heconcluded his article with the following words: \u201cI greet andwelcome Swami Vivekananda with all my heart. With his calmand serene appearance, his decent robes of renunciation, hiseloquence, his mastery of the sastras as well as his earnestness,activity, and organizing ability, I doubt not that he will succeedin realizing his aims. God bless him.\u201d123On the controversy raised in The Bangabashi aboutSwami Vivekananda\u2019s reception at Dakshineswar at the handsof Trailokya Babu, and on the Swami\u2019s critics in general, TheIndian Nation , edited by Babu N. N. Ghosh, had a very sensibleleader on 12 April 1897. We quote the relevant portion here,in spite of its length, as we believe it was written with thesincere motive of helping its readers to make a correct appraisalof the position of Swami Vivekananda at this time. It ran asfollows: \u201cThe carping to which Swami Vivekananda has beensubjected in some quarters in the town of his birth makes usfeel once again that there is not probably on the face of theearth a more cantankerous person, one more jealous of hisAN UGLY CONTROVERSYSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1278countrymen in particular, than the son of Bengal. Here is SwamiVivekananda who has glorified his religion and his countryand has made Hinduism an object, if not of admiration at anyrate of warm appreciation, to hundreds of those who hadhitherto held it in contempt. His mission was a self-appointedone, disinterested and self-sacrificing. He won laurels wherethe stoutest of his countrymen might have been covered withridicule and disgrace. He has lived an exemplary life, provedan effective teacher, and exhibited a magical gift of speaking.When he comes back to the land of his birth, all India, to herhonour be it said, receives him with open arms and gives hima warm embrace. In Bengal alone a miserable note of caviland sneer is heard. Bengal is the least orthodox of the Hinduprovinces of India. Possibly for that reason she is the loudestin her profession of orthodoxy. The Hindus of Ceylon, of theMadras Presidency, of Rajputana have laid themselves prostratebefore the Swami \u2014 genuine  Hindus who live according totheir professions, \u2014 and accepted him as a good, devout Hindu,and a sainted knight of Hinduism. But a Bengal faction thatdelights to make a trade of religion cannot but pick holes. Itcannot but snarl and growl. Accursed Bengal!\u201d124As we have said above, at the time when the orthodoxagitation against Swami Vivekananda was going on, his old\u201cfriends,\u201d the Christian missionaries, perhaps also PratapChandra Majumdar, and Dr. Barrows also joined in the fray.They had a common object, viz., to bring down the Swami inpublic estimation, so as to ruin his work, though their lines ofattack differed. In earlier Chapters we have dealt with thecampaign of vilification carried on against Swami Vivekanandaby the Christian missionaries and by Pratap Chandra Majumdarin America and also in India. In their present campaign theyreiterated their old charge that he was not a true representative1279of Hinduism, bolstering it with the arguments they borrowedfrom the chargesheet drawn up by the Hindu orthodoxopponents of the Swami in their own campaign against him.There was something funny in Christian missionaries andBrahmo reformers who did not believe in caste attempting tobelittle one for nonorthodoxy in such matters as eating unHindufood, dining with Mlechchhas, going on sea voyage, etc. Butin war one does not discriminate in the choice of the weaponsthat are available, or of allies, the only rule being to hit theenemy. We have already spoken about Swamiji\u2019s attitude toattacks on him by these old \u201cfriends\u201d of his, and it may sufficeto say that this time also, he met them with the same method ashe had adopted in the past \u2014 dignified silence. We may addthat he employed the same method in dealing with all othercritics who were simultaneously attacking him \u2014 theTheosophists, etc.A new addition to the ranks of the Swami\u2019s critics at thistime was Dr. Barrows who, as we have said above, had arrivedin India sometime before he had reached Madras, and havingfound that he had left Madras without waiting for him there,started making accusations against him. In earlier Chapterswe have said that Dr. Barrows, who was friendly to SwamiVivekananda in the early days of the Parliament, had changedconsiderably in his behaviour to him, possibly being influencedin this regard (so at least Swamiji thought) by Pratap ChandraMajumdar. It is likely that the coolness which thus began inhis relations with Swami Vivekananda developed into positivedislike as the latter\u2019s ideas of a universal religion, whichradically differed from his own conception of Christianity,became clearer to him day by day as the Parliament went onwith its work. Swamiji does not appear to have been aware ofthe fact that Dr. Barrows had already started making disparagingAN UGLY CONTROVERSYSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1280remarks about his work in the Parliament. (According to pressreports. Dr. Barrows had said that so far from being aphenomenal success, Swami Vivekananda was never anythingbetter than \u201cgood copy for the American press, ever hungeringfor novelty and sensations.\u201d) 125 In any case, when Swamijilearned from The Indian Mirror that Dr. Barrows was comingover to India to deliver a series of lectures connected withChristianity, he wrote to the Editor of that paper from Londonon 28 October 1896 asking his countrymen to show the utmostcourtesy to the visitor. He paid a suitable tribute of praise toDr. Barrows for his unique contribution to the success of theChicago Parliament, to which the Indian people owed theiropportunity to bring before the world the greatness of theirreligion and culture. Above all, he assured his countrymen thatDr. Barrows was coming to India \u201cin the sacred name ofreligion, in the name of one of the great teachers of mankind\u201dand that he would deal with the problem of religion in a highlyliberal and sympathetic Christian spirit. Swami Vivekananda\u2019sletter was published in The Indian Mirror on 19 November1896 and was copied in many other papers, the editors of all ofwhich respectfully endorsed his words, and earnestly appealedto their countrymen for courtesy being shown to Dr. Barrowsin the fullest measure.Dr. Barrows came, received a cordial welcome whereverhe went, and was shown the greatest courtesies by Indians, butfailed to come up to the expectations roused by SwamiVivekananda\u2019s description of him, nay, was found out to be nobetter and perhaps as worse than the Christian missionaryIndians knew very well. After he had delivered some lecturesat Poona, The Mahratta , edited by Mr. Tilak, commented on 7February 1897 as follows, \u201cThe venerable Swami\u2019s word ofrecommendation had preceded Dr. Barrows to this land; and1281we were bound in duty to show him every attention. . . . We donot, however, wish to find any fault with Dr. Barrows as apreacher of his own religion. His devotion to it is admirable. . . .But what we fear is that the Doctor\u2019s aspirations are not sonarrow. He is not content with the present extent ofChristendom; and like his aggressive trans Atlantic secularbrother, he will be satisfied with nothing less than a worldwideempire.\u201d 126 Editorial comments on other lectures delivered byDr. Barrows are not available to us, but Swami Vivekananda\u2019scomments on them made in a letter to Mary Hale on 20 April1897 may be safely taken as the consensus. The Swami wrote,\u201cDr. Barrows has reached America, by this time, I hope. Poorman! He came here to preach the most bigoted Christianity,with the result that nobody listened to him. Of course, theyreceived him very kindly; but it was my letter that did it. Icould not put brains into him! Moreover, he seems to be aqueer sort of man. I hear that he was mad at the nationalrejoicings over my coming home. You ought to  have sent abrainier man anyway, for the Parliament of Religions has beenmade a farce of in the Hindu mind by Dr. Barrows.\u201d 127We have no reports of any of the lectures delivered byDr. Barrows during his tour of India, but we give below someextracts from what he wrote in the concluding chapter of hismonumental work, \u201cThe World\u2019s Parliament of Religions\u201d.They give us a clear idea of his conception of Christianity, hisattitude to other faiths, and his appraisal of the work of theParliament of Religions. The reader may also recall what wehave said in an earlier Chapter about the views held byDr. Barrows on the question of the equality of all religions. Wefeel sure that in his lectures in India he expressed the verysame views that he had done in this work, and after reading theextracts, we are left in no doubt as to the cause of his failure toSWAMIJI AND DR. BARROWSSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1282make an impression in India. If, as he maintained in the work,the work of the Parliament of Religions was just a vindicationof Christianity as he conceived it and if he also said so in hislectures in India, he did make the Parliament appear to be littlemore than a farce in Indian eyes, as Swami Vivekananda rightlysaid. Let, however, Dr. Barrows speak for himself: 128\u201cIt was felt by many that to claim everything forChristianity and denying any good in other religions is notChristian. . . . The Parliament has been called a greatinterreligional clearinghouse to promote interchange ofopinions. Dr. Frederick A. Webb said, `Never did Christ seemso large and precious to me, never did Christian faith seem sonecessary to humanity and so sure to prevail as when theParliament closed\u2019. . . .\u201cThe prophecy made by the Rev. McPherson of Chicagothat this Parliament would afford the best single opportunityfor the study of comparative religions, has been fulfilled.Dr. James  Freeman Clarke has called this study thedemonstration of the truth of Christianity. . . .\u201cThe idea of evolving a cosmic or universal faith out ofthe Parliament was not present in the minds of its chiefpromoters. . . . The Parliament, it has been said, awakened anew world consciousness. . . . But while the men from India,for example, were at no intellectual disadvantage with the menof Christian America and Europe, it must be said that thetraining which they brought to the Parliament was largely fromChristian sources. . . .\u201cIt may be safely said that participation in the meetingdid not compromise any Christian speaker\u2019s position as abeliever in the supremacy and universality of the Gospel. There1283was no suggestion on the part of Christian speakers thatChristianity was to be thought of as on the same level with theother religions. . . . Dr. Layman Aleb has well said that thedifference between Christianity and the other religions is thatwe have something that they have not. `We have the Christ,the revelation of God, the ideal Man, the loving and sufferingSaviour. Those who attended the Parliament got a largerconception of what Christ is and Christ means\u2019. . . . . .\u201cMost men who read this volume in Christian lands willbelieve with Dr. Munger that `the Parliament shows that theworld moves and on the whole Christward\u2019. . . .\u201cThe Christian spirit pervaded the Parliament from firstto last. Christ\u2019s prayer was daily used. . . . His doctrine waspreached by a hundred Christians and by lips other thanChristian. `The Parliament ended in Calvary\u2019. . . . . .\u201cBecause the Parliament brought into clear light thebetter side of heathenism, and showed some of the mistakes ofChristian missionaries, a few have prophesized that missionaryactivity would certainly be diminished. The opposite effect willfollow. Some of the speakers at the Parliament objected to thecarrying of Christian theology to India, and demanded thatChristendom should minister to the sick, the famine struck andthe impoverished. The two go together, and have gone togethersince Jesus preached the Kingdom and healed the sick. . . .I doubt if any Orientals who were present misinterpreted thecourtesy with which they were received into a readiness on thepart of the American people to accept Oriental faiths in theplace of their own. On the other hand, they expect that out ofthe Christian civilization which, with all its imperfections, hasbeen a blessing to their peoples, will come an ever renewedSWAMIJI AND DR. BARROWSSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1284army of the messengers of Christ. `I regard Christ,\u2019 saysMazoomdar, `as an essential factor in the future of India.\u2019 `TheParliament of Religions opens up the gate of a golden era, whichwill purge off all the unChristian elements of the different faiths,both Christian and nonChristian and unite them all in Christ.\u2019(From The Unity and the Minister , Calcutta, 24 September.)\u201c . . . . The Parliament has shown that Christianity is stillthe great quickener of humanity, that it is now educating thosewho do not accept its doctrines, that there is no teacher to becompared with Christ, that there is no assured and transforminghope of conscious and blessed immortality outside the Christianscriptures, and that all the philosophies do not bring God sonear to man as he is brought by the Gospel of Christ. ThenonChristian world may give us valuable criticism and confirmscriptural truths and make excellent suggestions as to Christianimprovement but it has nothing to add to the Christian creed.It is with the belief, expressed by many a Christian missionary,that the Parliament marks a new era of Christian triumph, thatthe Editor closes these volumes.\u201dIt is quite likely that Swami Vivekananda had glancedover the pages of Dr. Barrows\u2019s book which was published inNovember 1893. They must have made it plain to him thatDr. Barrows was completely out of sympathy with all that hehad championed in the Parliament of Religions. He seems tohave known Dr. Barrows too well, as we may gather from thefollowing statement which was made by Mr. Krishna Menon,an Indian resident of London, to the Associated Press, when itwas announced in the American press that Dr. Barrows wasundertaking a \u201cpilgrimage\u201d to India. Mr. Menon said, \u201cI amconversant with the scheme of Dr. Barrows\u2019 proposed lecturesin India. I am surprised that he should be selected for the1285undertaking, because while he is known through his efforts inconnection with the Parliament of Religions, SwamiVivekananda and other leading Indians who attended theParliament do not regard him as a particularly profoundthinker. . I doubt if his lectures will have much effect.\u201d 129 Whythen did Swami Vivekananda recommend Dr. Barrows sohighly to his countrymen? A partial answer may be found inthe fact that he always made a distinction between \u201ca missionaryof Christ\u201d and \u201ca Christian missionary\u201d and in his belief thatDr. Barrows, whom he knew as a fervent Christian, would befound to be one of the former class. Moreover, he alwaysbelieved in interchange of thought between the East and theWest, and he seems to have expected that as he himself haddelivered the spiritual message of the East to America,Dr. Barrows would give Indians the message of Christ. It islikely that those who sent Dr. Barrows to India had hopes thathe would be a Swami Vivekananda in reverse in that country.However, within a short time of his coming to IndiaDr. Barrows belied all hopes and justified the worst fears thathad been entertained about his mission. He seems to haveascribed  his failure to Swami Vivekananda who, hecomplained, did not wait at Madras to meet him. In Madras, aswe have seen, there were some people who were critical of,and even bitterly opposed to Swami Vivekananda. Dr. Barrowsgave a ready ear to anybody who had anything to say againstthe Swami. He thus discovered that the latter was not a Brahminbut was a lowly Sudra. He told some of the staff of the IndianSocial Reformer who had a \u201cprivate interview\u201d with him thatit was not a fact that, if widows were allowed freely to remarry,it would be more difficult to find husbands for maidens, asSwami Vivekananda had said it was the case in the West. Hetold them that he had married three hundred couples as aSWAMIJI AND DR. BARROWSSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1286minister, but he did not think he had married more than threeor four widows. 130 The interview encouraged the paper toresume its onetime stand of bitter opposition to SwamiVivekananda. After leaving no stone unturned whereby he couldcounteract Swami Vivekananda\u2019s influence in India, he wentback to America, and immediately launched upon a campaignof lies against him. We have already spoken about the ludicrousstory he circulated in America that the Swami had asked forbeef when he had taken him to a restaurant. A more deadlyaccusation that he made against him was that he had slanderedAmerican women. The basis for this seems to have been,besides what he had said in some lectures somewhere, someremarks that Swami Vivekananda had made in the course ofthe interview that he had granted to a representative of TheMadras Mail , to which we have referred once, and which waspublished in that paper on 6 January 1897. We may discussthis point a little more fully, since nothing could be furtherfrom the truth than that Swami Vivekananda slanderedAmerican women.Swami Vivekananda had told the representative of thepaper, in reply to a question, that with the exception of theMissionaries and \u201cChurch women\u201d, the Americans were mosthospitable, kindhearted and good-natured. On being pressedto explain what he meant by \u201cChurch women\u201d, the Swami hadsaid, \u201cWhen a woman tries her best to find a husband she goesto all the bathing places imaginable and tries all sorts of tricksto catch a man. When she fails in her attempts she becomeswhat they call in America an `old maid\u2019 and joins the Church.Some of them become very `Churchey\u2019. These `Church women\u2019are awful fanatics. They are under the thumb of the prieststhere. Between them and the priests they make a hell of earth;and make a mess of religion.\u201d 131 These remarks were of a type1287which Swami Vivekananda sometimes made before friends,or in letters to intimates and were not meant to be publicized.(In an unpublished letter to Sri Manmatha Nath Bhattacharya,about which we have spoken in an earlier Chapter, he saidexactly these things about the \u201cChurchies\u201d.) He had what SisterNivedita has called \u201cthe colossal caprice of genius\u201d and oneshould think that the representative of The Madras Mail , whowas surely a veteran pressman and had had such experienceswith others, should have considered these remarks as \u201coff therecord\u201d and not have put them down in black and white for thepurpose of journalism. In any case, Swami Vivekananda\u2019sremarks about the \u201cChurchies\u201d of America, who had done allthat they could to make his life in America as miserable asthey could conspire to do, did not reflect his real opinions aboutAmerican women in general who were, as we know, his greatestadmirers and supporters in that country. In many of his lettersand utterances he paid the highest tribute to American womenfor their purity, and for their many qualities of head and heart.Some of these have been quoted by us in earlier Chapters ofthis work, and we need not repeat them here.In his blind rage, Dr. Barrows accused SwamiVivekananda of ingratitude towards him inasmuch as the latterdid not stay on in Madras till he arrived at the city, and pavethe path for his success in India as he claimed to have done forthe Swami\u2019s success in the Parliament of Religions. Admitting,for the sake of argument, that Dr. Barrows had helped SwamiVivekananda as much as he claimed he had done, the latter, aswe know, had paid back the debt of gratitude that he owed tohim fully by writing to The Indian Mirror asking his countrymento offer him courtesy and hospitality in a manner that befittedthe traditions of the Indian people. He could not wait on inMadras till he had met Dr. Barrows there because, as we know,SWAMIJI AND DR. BARROWSSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1288he was on the verge of a complete breakdown in his health andnot because, as Dr. Barrows alleged, he had slandered Americanwomen and so could not face him. As we have said a numberof times above, it was never Swami Vivekananda\u2019s practice toenter into a public controversy. This time too he maintained adignified silence, but gave his views on the charges ofDr. Barrows to Mary Hale in his letters to her which were notmeant for publication, and came to the knowledge of the publiclong after his death. (References to the subject are found inthree letters to Mary Hale, dated respectively Ramnad 30January 1897, Darjeeling 28 April 1897, and Almora 9 July1897.) The last-mentioned letter, from which we have quotedsome lines above, dealt with the charge of slandering Americanwomen. We give below the relevant portion of this letter. \u201cIhad,\u201d said the Swami, \u201cin a lecture said something about themissionaries and the origin of that species except the EnglishChurch gentlemen, and in that connection had to refer to thevery churchy women of America and their power of inventingscandals. This the missionaries are parading as an attack onAmerican women en masse to undo my work there, as theywell know that anything said against themselves will ratherplease the American people. My dear Mary, supposing I hadsaid all sorts of fearful things against the \u2018Yanks\u2019 \u2014 wouldthat be paying off a millionth part of what they say of ourmothers and sisters? \u2018Neptune\u2019s water\u2019s would be perfectlyuseless to wash off the hatred that the Christian \u2018Yanks\u2019 ofboth sexes bear to us, \u2018the heathens of India\u2019 \u2014 and what harmhave we done them? .132XWe have digressed rather long on the subject of the attacks thatwere made on Swami Vivekananda at this time by a curious1289assortment of critics \u2014 orthodox Hindus, Indian socialreformers, Christian missionaries, and Dr. Barrows. We nowgo back to the story of Swami Vivekananda\u2019s stay in his nativeprovince till he left for Almora on 6 May 1897. As we havesaid above, he returned to Darjeeling about 28 March and stayedthere till about 28 April. In the preceding section we have saidsomething about his life in Darjeeling. He had ample rest andon the whole felt better though not cured of the disease he wassuffering from. (Even after the discovery of insulin, whichbecame available for treatment of diabetes in 1922, the diseaseis still regarded as incurable, but it can be perfectly controlledand with proper treatment the diabetic can live out a normallife span.) The few events of his life during these days atDarjeeling are soon told. It was a pleasant surprise for him toreceive a copy of the Bengali monthly, Bharati , from the editor,Miss Sarala Ghoshal, a niece of Rabindranath Tagore.Obviously it was the issue for Chaitra , 1303 B.S. in whichthere was an editorial article on the Swami. Swami Vivekanandareplied to the accompanying letters, 133 making his commentson the article, in the course of which, inter alia , he said, \u201cThereare many things to be done, but means are wanting in thiscountry. . I heard in Japan that it was the belief of the girls ofthat country that their dolls would be animated if they wereloved with all their heart. The Japanese  girl never breaks herdoll. . . . I too believe that India will awake again if anyonecould love with all his heart the people of this country. . I haveexperienced even in my insignificant life that good motives,sincerity and infinite love can conquer the world.\u201d He informedher that his going again to the West (about which there was areference in the article) was still uncertain, as the country waslacking both in men and money. In reply to another letter fromSarala Debi, Swami Vivekananda wrote again to her on 24April 1897, thanking her for her sympathy. It was a long letter,AT DARJEELING AGAINSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1290in which he explained what the country needed and how itcould receive it. He stressed the need for the spread ofeducation, both for men and women, for which he expectedthe necessary money to come from England, provided Indianspirituality could be preached in the West. He said that womenruled in the West, and that if some women like her whopossessed spirit, culture, and knowledge of Vedanta could goto England and undertake the task of preaching, it would surelyhave great results. 134The known incidents of Swami Vivekananda\u2019s life atDarjeeling are few and, with regard to them also, we have notgot the dates, or many particulars. At Mr. Banerjee\u2019s housewhere he was staying, there was a gentleman named Mr. MotilalMukherjee who, like some old disciples of Sri Ramakrishnaabout whom we have spoken in an earlier Chapter, used tohave trances. In that state he would cry and groan and roll onthe ground beating his hands and feet against it. This form ofsadhana was, as we know, never liked by Narendranath, whohad done his best to check its excesses. Swami Vivekanandawanted to divert Motilal\u2019s spiritual tendencies and one daytouched him on the heart, with the result that the latter\u2019s entirereligious temperament was changed and he became an Advaitinand had no more such trances. Another day Motilal wassuffering from  high fever with delirium, and SwamiVivekananda touched him on the head which had theinstantaneous effect of bringing him to a normal state of health.135 Motilal accepted sannyasa in 1899 and became known asSwami Sachchidananda (2).136Mahendranath Datta has recorded an incident whichoccurred at this time of Swami Vivekananda\u2019s stay atDarjeeling. One morning after tea Swamiji went out for a walk,1291accompanied by two boys, who followed him at a little distancefrom him. At this time he was enjoying fairly good health and,as he went along the lonely mountain path with lovely scenesof natural beauty all around it, his mind became lost withinitself. Suddenly he exclaimed, \u201cI feel greatly hurt. I have muchpain.\u201d The two boys rushed towards him and asked, \u201cSwamiji,how did it happen? Where are you feeling the pain?\u201d SwamiVivekananda said, in a voice that was expressive of sufferingand pity, \u201cDidn\u2019t you see that coolie woman over there whomet with an accident by getting dashed against a rock? She islying dazed on the ground, being much hurt on her waist.\u201d Hethen began to rub his own waist with his hand, as if he wasfeeling much pain there. He did not proceed further in his walkand returned home, as if in great suffering. The two boys lookedat each other\u2019s faces with disbelief in their eyes. MahendranathDatta recalls in this connection the well-known story that oncewhile two boatmen were quarrelling with each other on a boatin the Ganga and one struck the other with a rod, the mark ofthe blow appeared on the back of Sri Ramakrishna, who wasstanding on the bank and saw what happened. He has given anexplanation of phenomena like these, which is beyond the layunderstanding, but still allows some guessing on it because hequotes as relevant to it certain statements of SwamiVivekananda, which are more intelligible. \u201cHuman body is themost delicate living instrument for experimenting the finervibrations and their causes.\u201d \u201cI am in  the sun, I am in themoon, I am in the stars, I am everywhere.\u201d \u201cI am a voice withoutform.\u201d 137Swami Vivekananda returned to Calcutta from Darjeelingon Wednesday, 28 April 1897, and, according to the programmethat had been announced before, left for Almora for reasons ofhealth (see Note No.94). He left Calcutta on 6 May, as weAT DARJEELING AGAINSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1292gather from his letter to Mrs. Ole Bull dated 5 May. 138 Thoughhis stay in Calcutta this time was for a bare week, he had thesatisfaction of carrying out the \u201conly idea\u201d that, as he had toldMary Hale later in a letter dated 9 July 1897, was \u201cburning inhis brain\u201d, viz., \u201cto start the machine for elevating the Indianmasses.\u201d This was the foundation of the Ramakrishna Missionwhich, as we know, has been the great legacy he has left for hiscountrymen and, indeed, for the world. On 1 May 1897, at hisinvitation, a great gathering took place at Balaram Babu\u2019shouse, in which all the monastic and lay disciples ofSri Ramakrishna participated. Addressing them in Bengali,Swami Vivekananda said that he had learned from hisexperiences in many countries that without organization nothinggreat, or permanent could be done. Announcing his proposalfor the formation of an Association, he declared as follows,\u201cThis Association will bear the name of him in whose namewe have become sannyasins, taking whom as your ideal youare leading the life of the householders in the field of activityof this Samsara, and whose holy name and the influence ofwhose unique life and teachings have, within twelve years ofhis passing away, spread in such an unthought-of way both inthe East and the West. Let this Sangha, or organization, betherefore named the Ramakrishna Mission. We are only theservants of the Master. May you all help us in this work.\u201d Healso said that since present conditions in the country did notfavour a democratic organization, the proposed associationshould be headed by a Dictator \u201cwhose orders everyone shouldobey.\u201dSri Girish Chandra Ghosh and other householderdisciples of the Master having given their hearty support to theSwami\u2019s proposal, the future method of work was discussedand some resolutions were passed. At a second meeting on 51293May 1897 the following aims and objects were adopted:\u201cThe Association (Sangha) shall be known as theRamakrishna Mission.\u201cThe aim of the Sangha is to preach those truths whichSri Ramakrishna has, for the good of humanity, preached anddemonstrated by practical demonstration in his own life, andto help others to put these truths into practice in their lives fortheir temporal, mental and spiritual advancement.\u201cThe duty of the Mission is to conduct in the right spiritthe activities of the movement inaugurated by Sri Ramakrishnafor the establishment of fellowship among the followers ofdifferent religions, knowing them all to be so many forms onlyof one undying Eternal Religion.\u201cIts Methods of Action are:(a) To train men so as to make them competent to teachsuch knowledge or sciences as are conducive to the materialand spiritual welfare of the masses: (b) to promote andencourage arts and industries; and (c) to introduce and spreadamong the people in general Vedantic and other religious ideasin the way in which they were elucidated in the life ofSri Ramakrishna.\u201cIndian Work Department:\u201cThe activities of the Mission should be directed to theestablishment of Maths and Ashrams in different parts of Indiafor the training of sannyasins and such of the householders asmay be willing to devote their lives to educate others, and tothe finding of the means by which they would be enabled toFOUNDATION OF THE RAMAKRISHNA MISSIONSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1294educate the people, by going about from one province toanother.\u201cIts work in the Foreign Department should be to sendtrained members of the Order to countries outside India to bringabout a closer relation and better understanding between Indiaand foreign countries.\u201cThe aims and ideals of the Mission being purely spiritualand humanitarian, it shall have no connection with politics.\u201cAnyone who believes in the mission ofSri Ramakrishna, or who sympathizes, or is willing to cooperatewith the abovementioned aims and objects of the Association,is eligible for membership.\u201d. . After the resolutions were passed, office-bearers wereappointed. Swami Vivekananda himself became the GeneralPresident, while Swamis Brahmananda and Yogananda becamethe President and Vice-president respectively of the Calcuttacentre. It was decided that meetings of the Association wouldbe held at Balaram Babu\u2019s house every Sunday afternoon. Thefirst general meeting was held on 9 May 1897 under thepresidency of Swami Brahmananda. For three years theRamakrishna Mission held its sittings at the same place;whenever the Swami was present in Calcutta he was presentand spoke and sang. For about two years the philanthropic andmissionary work was carried on through the medium of thisAssociation. In April, 1898, the building of the central Math ofthe Order was begun at Belur. The dedication took place on 9December of the same year and the final occupation on 2January 1899. In 1901 Swami Vivekananda made over themanagement of the Math to a number of Trustees by a Deed ofTrust. Soon afterwards, the Ramakrishna Mission Association1295ceased to function as an independent organization, and the Mathauthorities themselves carried on the philanthropic andcharitable work originally undertaken by the MissionAssociation. In course of time, with the growth of its scopeand public responsibilities, the need of a separate organizationwas felt, and in 1909 a Society under the name of theRamakrishna Mission was registered under Act XXI of1860.Henceforth there were the twin institutions: the RamakrishnaMath, which had been registered in 1899 and which is vowedto the maintenance and diffusion of the Universal Religion;and the Ramakrishna Mission, which is open to laymen as wellas to religious, which exercises jurisdiction over all works ofpublic utility, both philanthropic and charitable. The twoinstitutions are at once akin, allied and yet separate. TheGoverning Body of the Ramakrishna Mission is identical withthe Trustees of the Math, and the principal workers of theMission are members of the Ramakrishna Math, and both havetheir headquarters at Belur Math. 139The twin aims, viz., personal salvation and service ofhumanity (atmanah mokshartham jagaddhitaya cha) , whichSwami Vivekananda held up before his gurubhais and disciples,have been pursued by his followers ever since. In both directionsthere has been a tremendous expansion and at the present daythey are carried on all over the world. Not only have Mathsand Asramas ramified in India and outside, but humanitarianwork has reached almost colossal proportions. The interlinkingof the two aims and proclaiming it to be a way of sadhana, oreven a higher way of sadhana, as Swami Vivekananda did,however, produced a conflict in many sincere souls whoardently longer for salvation as the one aim of human life andwho considered worldly activities in any form as entanglementin maya. In the earlier Chapter of this work we have dealt manyOFFICE BEARERS OF THE MISSIONSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1296times with Swami Vivekananda\u2019s conception of siva jnane jivapuja which he claimed to be consistent with, if not the core ofSri Ramakrishna\u2019s teachings and of the refusal of some of hi:gurubhais to see eye to eye with him on the subject. Thesincerity with which the latter held on to their views cannot bequestioned but, in spite of their misgivings, they co-operatedwith their great leader, recognizing in their heart of hearts thatthe Master was working through him.We may say something here about the mental difficulties:which they experienced. On the very day when the RamakrishnaMission was founded, after the members had departed, SwamYogananda raised the question. He told Swamiji that he was:working with Western methods and asked whether he couldsay that their Master left any such instructions. In reply, SwamiVivekananda put a counter-question, \u201cHow do you know thatall this is not on Sri Ramakrishna\u2019s lines?\u201d He then said withwarmth, \u201cThe Master had an infinite breadth of feeling. Dareyou shut him up within your own limited views of life? I willbreak down these limits and scatter broadcast over the earthhis boundless inspiration. He never instructed me to introduceany rites of his own worship .. I haven\u2019t been born to foundone more sect in a world already teeming with sects. We havebeen blessed with obtaining refuge at the feet of the Masterand we are born to carry his message to the .dwellers of thethree worlds.\u201d Swami Yogananda did not utter a word of dissentand so Swamiji continued: \u201cTime and again have I received ifthis life marks of his grace. He stands behind and gets all thiswork done by me ..... SO casting all doubts away, please help,my work; and you will find everything fulfilled by his will.\u201dSwami Yogananda said, \u201cYes, whatever you will, shall befulfilled; and, are we not all ever obedient to you? Now andthen I do clearly see how Sri Ramakrishna is getting all these1297things done through you. And yet, to speak plainly, somemisgiving rises at intervals, for as we saw it, his way of doingthings was different.\u201d He again asked him to be sure that hewas not going astray from the Master, and Swamiji said,\u201cSri Ramakrishna is not exactly what the ordinary followershave comprehended him to be. He had infinite moods andphases. . . . Thousands of Vivekanandas spring forth throughone gracious glance of his eyes! But instead of doing that, hehas chosen to get things done through me this time as his singleinstrument, and what can I do in this matter, you see?\u201d 140That day the matter was not pressed further, SwamiYogananda\u2019s doubts seeming to be laid at rest, and after Swamijileft on some business, he talked with Sarat ChandraChakravarti, who was all along present there, and went onhighly praising him. He said he would be blessed if he hadeven a hundredth of the reverence that he had for the Master.He remarked, \u201cIn Naren, the knowledge of the Vedas possessedby a Rishi, the renunciation of Sankara, the heart of Buddha,the freedom from maya and fullest manifestation of theknowledge of Brahma of Sukadeva, are found combined inone person.\u201d 141 Nevertheless, as we shall see presently, therewas an unpleasant incident later. Meanwhile, one of thestaunchest of Swami Vivekananda\u2019s supporters among hisgurubhais, and one who was among the first and foremostamong them actually to practise his creed of service \u2014 SwamiAkhandananda \u2014 had serious misgivings, if not about theprinciples, about the methods that Swamiji wanted him to adopt.He was doing famine relief work at Mahula (Murshidabad Dist.)without caring for his health or comforts or even life withSwami Vivekananda\u2019s fullest approval and support. The latter,however, wanted him to be methodical and practical in hisapproach and insisted that he should publish regular reports ofTHE SWAMI\u2019S GURUBHAISSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1298his work in the papers. Swami Akhandananda could notreconcile himself to this publicity and avoided sending anyreport. Swami Brahmananda, following Swamiji, was equallyinexorable in his demand for a report, till at last SwamiAkhandananda, in desperation, sat down to write \u2014 only tovisualize in his mind\u2019s eye the Master telling him, \u2014 \u201cDo youwant me or the public? On one side am I, and on the other sidethe public .\u201d He burst into tears but he did produce a reportsometime later. Many a staunch follower of SwamiVivekananda, we may be sure, similarly found it hard to bridgethe gulf between God and public responsibility, though all ornearly all were ultimately brought round to his views. 142We have no record of any further discussions on thesubject between Swami Vivekananda and his gurubhais till twoyears later, when, one day, begun lightly, they took a seriousturn. The date was approximately March April 1899 whenSwamiji was again seriously thinking of paying a second visitto the West. It would seem that at the time a proposal had beenmade to Sarala Ghoshal that she should accompany him thereand carry on Vedanta work about which he had given a broadhint to her in his letter to her dated 24 April 1897, to which wehave referred above. The great House of Tagore, always in thevanguard of India\u2019s progress, seems to have been moved bySwami Vivekananda\u2019s advent, and we have seen howJyotirindranath Tagore had heartily welcomed the Swami\u2019sstand on the Upanishads. Some talks of cooperation in someform with the Swami\u2019s movement seemed to have been carriedon in some Brahmo circles. On 14 February 1899 SisterNivedita paid a visit to Maharshi Devendra Nath Tagore, andoffered  him her pranam, feeling that she was doing so on behalfof the Swami too. The Maharshi feelingly referred to the boyNaren\u2019s visit to him in his boat, and said that he would greatly1299like Swami Vivekananda to come to him once again. Whenthe latter heard about it he was moved and asked Sister Niveditato fix a day as early as possible when they could both meet theold man. 143 We have little information about what Swamijiand the Maharshi talked about at the meeting, which took placesoon afterwards, on Saturday, 19 February or whether at alltheir conversation turned on the subject we have been speakingabout. 144 It seems, however, that it was soon after this, if not asa sequel to it, that one Priyanath Sastri came from the Maharshito meet the Swami and discussed with him Swamiji\u2019s ideasand methods of work. After he had heard the Swami fully, Mr.Sastri said, \u201cWe have the same opinions as you on all subjectswith the exception of only one, viz., the idea that you have onavatar.\u201d The Swami said, \u201cBut I do not preach that the Masterwas an avatar.\u201d 145This remark of Swamiji sparked off the discussionbetween him and some of his gurubhais that we have spokenof above as having taken a serious turn. Even as the Swamispoke those words, Swami Yogananda, who along with someothers was present at the discussions between the Swami andPriyanath Sastri, whispered \u2014 his eyes reddened with anger\u2014 \u201cWhat does Naren say?\u201d and as soon as Mr. Sastri left, heand some others expressed their strong objection to his remarkson avatar. The main point that they wanted to make out wasthat it was the Master who had made Swamiji great. The Swamilaughingly replied, \u201cWithout me, who would have made yourMaster known to the world?\u201d Swami Yogananda retorted,\u201cWithout him, you would at best have shaped out to be anotherbig barrister like W. C. Banerjee.\u201d The conversation becamewarmer till there  was a flare-up. According to another account146 the conversation that day started with lighthearted criticismsof Swamiji\u2019s methods of work by some of his gurubhais, someA VISIT TO THE MAHARSHISWAMI VIVEKANANDA1300of whom, as we know, held that they were based on Westernideas and a deviation from those of the Master. Equallylightheartedly, the Swami made some replies, till, turning toone of them, he remarked, still in a jocular way, \u201cWhat do youknow? You are an ignorant man. You are a fit child ofSri Ramakrishna. Like Guru like child! Your study ended, likethat of Prahlada, at seeing the first Bengali alphabet `Ka\u2019, forit reminded Prahlada of Krishna and he could not proceedfurther because of the tears that came into his eyes! You arebhaktas, or, in other words, sentimental fools! What do youunderstand of religion? You are only good at praying with foldedhands, `O Lord, how beautiful is Your nose, how sweet areYour eyes\u2019 and all such nonsense, and you think that yoursalvation is secured, and Sri Ramakrishna will come at the finalhour and take you up by the hand to the highest heaven! Study,public preaching, and doing humanitarian works are, accordingto you, Maya! Because he said to someone, \u201cSeek and findGod first; doing good to the world is a presumption. As if Godis such an easy thing to be achieved! As if He is such a fool asto make Himself a plaything in the hands of the imbecile!\u201d(Bythe way, the gurubhai whom Swamiji thus stormed at couldnot be, as the context may imply, Swami Yogananda, who hadat least passed the Entrance examination, and he may havebeen Swami Adbhutananda who was unlettered.)His anger was mounting, but even so far it was undercontrol, though from fun and merriment he had turned to jestand sarcasm. Suddenly, however, after a little pause, he burstout in a thundery voice \u2014 \u201cYou think you understandSri Ramakrishna more than myself! You want to preachRamakrishna as you have understood him, which is mightylittle. Who cares for your Ramakrishna ? . . . . I am not afollower of Ramakrishna or anyone, but of him only who serves1301and helps others, without caring for his own bhakti or mukti. \u201cHis face looked like a flaming fire, his eyes dazzled, his voicewas choked, his whole frame shook with intense emotion. Hecould not contain himself any longer. Tears streamed from hiseyes. Like a flash of lightning he was up on his feet and ranfrom the room to his sleeping apartment. His gurubhais werealarmed: he was not well for a long time, and since hispilgrimage to Amarnath his heart had become permanentlydilated. They were attempting to keep him merry and evenloved to see him using invectives against them so that his mindcould be drawn away from the tension of thought to which itnormally gravitated. They repented having criticized him asthey had done, oblivious of what might be the consequences.A few of them went to his room, with cautious steps, someminutes later. He was in deep meditation. They waited insilence. . An hour afterwards Swami Vivekananda returned.His features still bore the traces of the violent storm, but hehad recovered his calm. He said softly, \u201cWhen one attainsbhakti, one\u2019s heart and nerves become so soft that they cannotbear even the touch of a flower. Do you know that I cannoteven read a novel nowadays? I cannot think or talk ofSri Ramakrishna long, without being overwhelmed. So I amtrying and trying always to keep down the welling rush ofbhakti. I am trying to bind and bind myself with the iron chainsof jnana, for still my work is unfinished and my message to theworld not yet fully delivered. So, as soon as I find that bhaktifeelings are trying to come up and sweep me off my feet, I givea hard knock to them and make myself as firm as adamant bybringing up austere jnana. Oh, I have work to do! I am a slaveof Ramakrishna, who left his work to be done by me and willnot give me rest till I have finished it. . . . . Oh, his love forme!\u201d As he spoke, the torrent of bhakti again  welled up andfearing another outburst Swami Yogananda gently suggestedTHE SWAMI versus HIS GURUBHAISSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1302that as it was warm in the room they might have a stroll on theroof of the house (Balaram Babu\u2019s house). There they divertedhis mind with light talk till it was far into the night and he washis normal self again. 147Never again did they question him about his work, orhis methods, for apart from the fact that any excitement washarmful to his health, they were afraid that such tempestuousoutbursts might bring closer to his mind his \u201creal nature,\u201d andthey remembered Sri Ramakrishna\u2019s warning that once he knewit he would leave his body. They now realized as they had notdone before the truth of what he used often to tell them that thepopular idea that Sri Ramakrishna was all bhakti and he wasall jnana was incorrect and that it was really the other way.They also heard from his own lips now at what cost he had hisjnana. We may remind the reader about what we have saidmany times above, viz ., that while the sons of Sri Ramakrishnaoften differed from each other in their spiritual ideas andmethods of sadhana, all recognized that such diversity wasinevitable and essential. They were bound to each other in loveand to their guru and their leader in respect in a manner ratherdifficult for the lay mind to understand. We have said abovewhat Swami Yogananda thought about his Narenbhai, and wemay add that he fully accepted the principles on which theSwami founded the Mission, of which he was the Vice-president, the duties in connection with which he dischargedwith singular devotion till his last days.It further appears that, possibly after the incident narratedabove, Swami Vivekananda\u2019s gurubhais had bidden himGodspeed in his talks with the Brahmo leaders for cooperation,even if it could be had by the sacrifice on their part of \u201csomeobject that they specially cherished.\u201d The negotiations fell1303through, as we learn from Swamiji\u2019s letter to Sarala Devi dated16 April 1899, not because of Guru worship being insisted uponby them but because, as Swamiji put it, some \u201cwished to puttheir own hobby in place of ours.\u201d We do not know what wasexactly the \u201chobby\u201d or terms for cooperation that the otherparty wanted to impose, but it may be guessed that the failureto reach an agreement was still something about guru puja. Inhis letter, above referred to, Swami Vivekananda is bitter againstthose \u201cpatriotic souls who can join with us if only we give upthe worship of the guru.\u201d He said, \u201cWell, if, as they pose, theyare indeed panting and struggling so much \u2014 almost to thepoint of dissolution from their body \u2014 to serve the country,how can the single accident of guru worship stop everything?\u201dHe ended his letter with biting criticism of these men (he knewhow to do so when he chose to do so) \u2014 \u201cI put to you, do youthink anything great will come of such patriotism, or anysubstantial good proceed from such assistance? . . . . I, for one,am inclined to think that those people were best in a glass case:the more they keep away from actual work, the better.\u201d 148It may be mentioned here that Swami Vivekananda\u2019shope that Sarala Devi might accompany him to the West anddo Vedanta work there, about which a mild hint was given toher by him in his letter to her from Darjeeling (see above), wasnot realized. That was not due to any lack of patriotism orsincerity on the part of Sarala Devi, about whom Swamijicontinued to have the warmest feelings of affection andadmiration. In her work, Jibaner Jhara Pata (Life\u2019s FallenLeaves), which was published long after the events recordedin it happened, Sarala Devi sought to explain why, though drawnso powerfully to Swamiji, she could not accept him as someothers, e.g., Miss Noble, did. It was her own mentalunpreparedness (nijer maner aprastutata) , shyness (sangkoch), and objection of her guardians which, she  says, wereTHE SWAMI AND SARALA DEVISWAMI VIVEKANANDA1304responsible for this. As regards the last factor, which must havebeen the determining one, it is clear that in spite of much mutualunderstanding and sympathy, the elders of the Tagore familycould not persuade themselves to participate in the movementlaunched by Swami Vivekananda. It is a curious fact thatRabindranath Tagore and Swami Vivekananda were indifferentto each other and that in the contemporary writings of neitherof them, there is a reference to the other personality. 149 Be thatas it may, Sarala Devi tells us that her own lack of eagernesswas due to some \u201c tamasic samskaras of long standing\u201d(chiragata tamasic samskara) and shyness ( bhiruta ).Nevertheless, says she, Swamiji\u2019s influence continued to workon her, and she met him at least twice after his return (secondtime) from the West (see Chapter 13, Section XIII below).The last meeting with Swamiji, says she, \u201cwas engravedin her memory forever.\u201d He fed her with dishes of many lands,all cooked by himself, and she was overwhelmed with, andeven mentally rebelled at, the courtesy shown to her by himand others at the Belur Math which, she felt, she did not deserve.However, as she tells us, after Swamiji\u2019s death, his influencecontinued to work within her: she entered into the spirituallife. She paid a visit to and stayed at Mayavati Advaita Asramafor some time. She threw herself heart and soul into the antpartition movement in Bengal, which was the beginning of theindependence struggle in India. The beginning of spiritual lifeabout which she speaks may have taken place after 1920, orthereabout. The present writer who was at Lahore in 1921_23once chanced to meet her husband Pandit RambhujDattachaudhuri, there some time possibly in 1922. Sarala Deviwas living at the place since her marriage. In reply to his enquiryabout her, Mr. Dattachaudhuri said, \u201cShe is not here! She hastaken up vanaprashtha . She is at Hardwar now!\u201d The author1305had a last glimpse of her sometime in the early thirties. Hefound her at the house of the famous saint of Howrah, BijayChandra Chatterjee, taking down notes of talks he was givingher in a big copybook.We go back to the story of Swami Vivekananda\u2019s stay inCalcutta before he left for Almora on 6 May 1897. We narratehere three events, recorded by Sarat Chandra Chakravarti inhis SwamiSishyaSamvad . The first is placed by him in Apriland the second in March, 1897, both, it would seem, incorrectly.The third event happened, according to him, probably inMarch, 1897. The first event was the initiation of four personsinto sannyasa, the second Swamiji\u2019s visit to Mahakali Pathshala,and the third a conversation between Swamiji and GirishChandra Ghosh. From the fact, mentioned by Sarat ChandraChakravarti, that Swami Ramakrishnananda was present onthe occasion of the initiation ceremony, it must have taken placenot in April as stated by him but sometime between Swamiji\u2019sarrival in Calcutta in February and the middle or the last weekof March when Swami Ramakrishnananda left for Madras.Also, since some of these young men were living for aconsiderable time at the Alambazar Math after leaving homein anxious expectation of their receiving initiation from Swamijihimself, an earlier date would seem to be more likely. The fourlucky young men were Kalikrishna Basu, Kanai Sen, SushilChakravarti, and Jogendra Nath Chatterjee. After initiation theybecame known respectively as Swamis Virajananda,Nirbhayananda, Prakasananda and Nityananda. Of them thefirst named had joined the Math in 1891, the next two muchlater, and the last, who was much older than Swamiji, just beforehis return to India. The reader may recall that Jogendra NathChatterjee was a resident of Baranagore who used to help theyoung monks, whenever he heard that they were in want ofTHE SWAMI AND SARALA DEVISWAMI VIVEKANANDA1306food (see Chapter 5, Section II above). He used to come to theMath often and spend much time with the monks, making theplace lively with his witty conversation. Like Timon of Athens,he loved to eat and feed and in doing so squandered his notinconsiderable patrimony. He loved the young monks verymuch. After the death of his wife and having no children of hisown, he left the world and settled down at Varanasi (Banaras).150 Sushil came from a devout Brahmin family living inSerpentine Lane, Calcutta, of which another member, viz., hisown elder brother, Sudhir, as we shall presently see, was toreceive mantradiksha as well as brahmacharyadiksha fromSwamiji. Kalikrishna belonged to Simla (the seat of SwamiVivekananda\u2019s paternal residence) and Kanai to Ahiritola. It isinteresting that the old man about whom we have said inChapter 2 as having warned the child, Biley, that there was abrahmadaitya in a champa tree in his compound was none otherthan Kalikrishna\u2019s grandfather. Kanai, like Sri Ramakrishna\u2019sdisciples, Adharchandra Sen and Kaliprasad Chandra (laterSwami Abhedananda) was a Subarnabanik by caste (see NoteNo. 27, appended to Chapter 3 above).On the eve of the initiation ceremony, some of thegurubhais of Swami Vivekananda raised serious objections withrespect to one of the four because of his past life. None of ourauthorities gives out the name of the one against whom therewas this kind of objection, which is unfair to all of them.However, Swamiji brushed aside the objection, saying, \u201cWhatis this! If we shrink from sinners, who else will save them?Besides, the very fact that one has taken refuge in the Math inhis desire to lead a better life, shows that his intentions aregood, and we must help him.\u201d (One may recall Swamiji\u2019s refusalto debar prostitutes from attending Sri Ramakrishna\u2019s birthdayanniversary celebrations at Dakshineswar, and the Master\u2019sattitude to sinners in general.) However, the ceremony was a1307very impressive one  and delighted Swamiji more than the hugeovations in his honour. On the day previous to it, SwamiVivekananda spoke of nothing but renunciation, his eyesemitting fire and his words infusing strength into the aspirants.He concluded, \u201cRemember, for the salvation of one\u2019s own souland for the good and happiness of the many, the sannyasin isborn in the world. To sacrifice his own life for others, to alleviatethe misery of millions rending the air with their cries, to wipeaway the tears from the eyes of the widow, to console the heartof the bereaved mother, to provide the ignorant and thedepressed masses with the ways and means for the struggle forexistence and make them stand on their own feet, to preachbroadcast the meaning of the sastras to one and all withoutdistinction, for their material and spiritual welfare, to rousethe sleeping lion of Brahman in the hearts of all beings by thediffusion of the light of knowledge \u2014 the sannyasin is born inthe world.\u201dAddressing the four aspirants in particular, SwamiVivekananda said, \u201cCan you strive with your whole souls todo these things? Take this path only after serious reflection.There is yet time to return to the old life. Are you ready to obeymy orders implicitly? If I ask you to face a tiger, or a venomoussnake, if I ask you to jump into the Ganga and catch a crocodile,or if I want to sell you to work the rest of your life in a teagardenin Assam as coolies, or if I order you to starve yourselves todeath or burn yourselves in a slow fire, thinking it will be foryour good, are you ready to obey me instantly?\u201d The fourBrahmacharis implied their assent by bowing their heads insilence. They then performed their own sraddha rites, offeringpindas to their own manes, the mantras being chanted to themby Sarat Chandra Chakravarti, as instructed by Swamiji, andwent through other processes, such as the tonsure. Next dayINITIATION OF DISCIPLESSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1308the Swami initiated them into sannyasa, and they received newnames, as given above. We may mention in this connectionthat another ceremony took place at the Alambazar Math aboutthis time. On 19 Baisakh, 1304 B.S., or 1 May 1897 151 theSwami gave mantradiksha to Sarat Chandra Chakravarti (hewas a married man), and mantradiksha as well as brahma-charyadiksha to Sudhir Chandra Chakravarti (SwamiPrakasananda\u2019s elder brother). Sudhir was in touch with theSwami since the very day of his arrival in Calcutta, and a littlelater he was taken into the Order by him, being namedBrahmachari Suddhananda. Later still, in the same year, 1897,he received initiation into sannyasa from Swami Niranjana-nanda, and became known as Swami Suddhananda. (In June,1921, when the present writer was on a pilgrimage to Hardwar,he happened one evening to arrive at the Ramakrishna MissionAsrama at Kankhal. At the request of Swami Suddhananda,who was the President of the asrama at the time, he stayedwith the monks for two or three days. The simple, lovinghospitality of the monks and Swami Suddhananda with hisgentle, inward-looking eyes are engraved on his memory.)The second event that we have to narrate, viz., his visitto the Mahakali Pathashala, occurred shortly before the Swamileft for Almora. Though Sarat Chandra Chakravarti, whoaccompanied the Swami in a hired carriage to the institution,says that the event happened in April, 1897, we learn from anews item in The Indian Mirror of 8 May that the Swami visitedthe place \u201clast Thursday\u201d, which means 6 May, the very dayon which he left for Almora. Swamiji was then living at BalaramBabu\u2019s house from which place the school, which was thensituated at Chorebagan, was not far off. As the Swami wasabout to leave for the school, the time being morning, SaratChandra Chakravarti turned up and he asked him to accompany1309him. He did not tell him his destination till the carriage hadleft the Brahmo Samaj building in Cornwallis Street (nowrenamed Bidhan Sarani) behind, when he directed thecoachman to proceed towards Chorebagan and told his disciplethat Tapasvini Mataji, who had founded a new type girls\u2019 schoolwhere instruction was given on orthodox lines, had invited himto visit her school. When they reached the place, TapasviniMataji received Swamiji respectfully and took him to aclassroom, where the girls, as asked by her, recited the Sanskritmeditation of Lord Siva and demonstrated how they were taughtthe worship of the god in the school. Swamiji was highlydelighted and expressed his appreciation of the measure ofsuccess Mataji had attained by her perseverance and applicationin the cause of diffusion of knowledge among women. Matajisaid she looked upon the girls as the Divine Mother and herwork as service to Her.Being asked to record his opinion about the school,Swami Vivekananda wrote the following in the Visitor\u2019s Book:\u201cHave great pleasure in witnessing the good work inauguratedin our city by Mataji. The move appears to me to be in the rightdirection and deserves the support of all who desire to see theirdaughters educated on national lines.\u201d 152 Later, as they werereturning in a carriage to Balaram Babu\u2019s house, SwamiVivekananda highly praised Tapasvini Mataji who, born at aplace far off from Bengal, had founded an institution of such atype in Calcutta, and her spirit of renunciation and dedication.He, however, disliked, said he, the sight of some malehouseholders acting as teachers there. \u201cThe duty of teaching inthe school,\u201d observed he, \u201cought to devolve on educatedwidows and brahmacharinis. It is good to avoid in this countryany association of men with women\u2019s schools.\u201d The discipleobjecting that Gargis and Maitreyis might be difficult to findA VISIT TO THE MAHAKALI PATHASHALASWAMI VIVEKANANDA1310in India at the present day, the Swami said, \u201cDo you thinkwomen of the type don\u2019t exist now in this country? Still on thissacred soil in India, this land of Sita and Savitri,  among womenmay be found such character, such spirit of service, suchaffection, compassion, contentment, and reverence, as I couldnot find anywhere in the world. In the West, the women didnot very often seem to be women at all, they appeared to bequite the replica of men. Driving vehicles, drudging in offices,attending schools, doing professional duties! In India alonethe sight of feminine modesty and reserve soothes the eye!\u201d 153The visit is not without importance, since it elicited somethingof Swami Vivekananda\u2019s opinion on the education of womenin India.The third event which we have to narrate here is placedby the author of the SwamiSishyaSamvad tentatively in March,1897. But since at the time of occurrence Swamiji was stayingat Balaram Babu\u2019s house and since probably this was the sameperiod of his stay there during which he had visited MahakaliPathashala, it is likely that the event occurred in April or earlyMay (before he left for Almora). A copy of the Rigveda editedby Max Muller had been procured from a rich man\u2019s houseand Swamiji was helping Sarat Chandra Chakravarti to read it.In the course of the lesson, Swamiji said casually that hesometimes thought that Sayana had reincarnated as Max Muller.The disciple objected that Sayana could be expected to choosea Brahmana body in the sacred land of India rather than takebirth as a Mlechchha. Swami Vivekananda said that it was onlythe ignorant who make such distinction as one is an Arya andanother a Mlechchha and that one who is the interpreter of theVedas and the shining image of the highest knowledge itself isabove such thinking. For the good of humanity, he may takehis birth anywhere in the world, said he, adding that if he had1311not been born in the West the huge expenses for the publicationcould not be found. However, as the lessons were proceeding,Mr. Girish Chandra Ghosh turned up, and sat listening for sometime. Swamiji  said, \u201cWell, G.C., you never care to study thesethings, and instead pass all your time with your Krishnas andVishnus,\u201d meaning that he was content with faith and did notcare to acquire sastric knowledge.The great litterateur and bhakta instantly replied, \u201cI haveneither the leisure nor the intellect to penetrate into them.Sri Ramakrishna made you read them because he had muchteaching and preaching work to be done through you. As far asI am concerned , I bow to them from a distance, and throughhis grace alone I shall cross the ocean of the world.\u201d He boweddown many times before the copy of the Rigveda, uttering,\u201cAll Victory to Ramakrishna in the form of the Veda!\u201d Swamijisat mute and as if in a deep reverie, when Girish Babu suddenlycalled out to him and said, \u201cWell, Naren, let me ask you onething. Of Vedas and Vedanta you have read enough. But arethere any remedies prescribed in them for these wailings, thesecries of hungry mouths, these abominable sins like adultery,etc. and the many other evils and miseries that one meets withevery day? The mother of the house there, who at one time feddaily fifty mouths, has not the wherewithal to cook even forherself and her children for the last three days! The lady ofsuch and such a family has been violated by ruffians and torturedto death. The young widow of so-and-so has succumbed fromcausing abortion to hide her shame!. . I ask you, Naren, haveyou found in the Vedas any preventive for these evils?\u201d AsGirish Babu was speaking, Swami Vivekananda\u2019s large, lotuslike eyes were filling with tears, unnoticed by others and assoon as Girish Babu had finished, he rushed out of the room tohide his feelings. Addressing Sarat Chandra, Girish Babu thenSWAMI AND GIRISH CHANDRA GHOSHSWAMI VIVEKANANDA1312said, \u201cDid you see, Bangal ? What a great, loving heart! I don\u2019thonour your Swamiji simply because he is a great Pandit versedin the  Vedas; but I honour him for that great heart of his whichjust made him retire weeping at the sorrows of his fellowbeings.\u201dAs they went on conversing with each other, SwamiVivekananda returned and had a few words with both. SwamiSadananda having dropped in at the time, he told him that hisheart was gnawing with pain at the tale of the country\u2019s miserythat G. C. was depicting just then, and asked, \u201cCan you doanything for our country?\u201d Swami Sadananda said, \u201cThe servantis ready ( banda taiyar hai ).\u201d Swami Vivekananda asked himto do something by opening a small relief centre at least. Andturning to Girish he said, \u201cDo you know, Girish Babu, thethought comes to me that even if I have to undergo a thousandbirths to relieve the misery of the world, even to remove theleast pain from anyone, I shall certainly do so!\u201d We mayconclude this Chapter by saying that Swamiji\u2019s gurubhais anddisciples were seized with the generous passion of his pitifulheart and, one and all, they dedicated themselves to the multipleforms of human service, which he pointed out to them. Duringthe summer of 1897, Swami Akhandananda, who was the firstof his gurubhais to be seized of this spirit of his, with the helpof two disciples sent him by Swamiji, started famine reliefwork at various places in the Murshidabad district, a little laterfounding an orphanage at Mahula, removed afterwards toSargachhi. The same year, 1897, Swami Trigunatita opened afamine centre at Dinajpur, which came to the rescue of eighty-four villages. Other centres were established at Deoghur,Dakshineswar and Calcutta. The following year, April May,1898, a mobilization of the whole Ramakrishna Mission againstplague that had broken out in Calcutta began. Swami"

After the Swami left Ramnad, he, however, fadedout, and we hear little about him in connection with Swami Vivekananda\u2019s lifeand movement. Asked by the Editor of The South Indian Mail , Madras, abouta year later whether he attached himself to Swami Vivekananda\u2019s Mission or tothe Theosophical Society, the Raja replied, \u201cI attach myself to none exclusively.I am an admirer of both.

It may bementioned, however, that Swami Vivekananda\u2019s attitude to him seems to haveremained unchanged. Learning from Swami Ramakrishnananda that the workat Madras was not going on well for want of money, he wrote to him on 19August 1897 that if his friends there did not find out a way he should pack upand come to Calcutta, or remove the Math to Ramnad.

Janes, dated 7 June 1897, as follows: \u201cTheGerman Schools, the English Orientalists and our own Emerson testify to thefact that it is literally true that Vedantic thought pervades the Western thoughtof today, and it is in this sense only that Vivekananda could mean that thousandsin the West are Vedantists \u2014 a philosophy able to include sectarians,\u201d ( TheLife , cited, III , 174).

The statement is not quite correct forthough Swami Niranjanananda (one of the two gurubhais) had gone to Colombo,the other (Swami Sivananda) had gone up to Madura only where he had joinedSwami Vivekananda ( Bhaktamalika , cited, I, 269). The disciple who, accordingto Prof. Iyer, alighted from the train along with the Swami, was obviouslySwami Sadananda, who joined the Swami at Madras only. He had come to thisplace to witness the reception of his Master there and was standing by theroadside when Swamiji was being taken in a procession from the station toKernan Castle. Sighting him, Swamiji shouted, \u201c Hither, my child Sadananda,come hither,\u201d and getting his carriage stopped, made him come and sit by hisside.

It wrote, pontifically, as follows:\u201cVivekananda deserves honour at the hands of his countrymen, specially of histownsmen: but carriage pulling is a European demonstration, and howevermuch it might suit a political hero it is scarcely the sort of thing that we expectto be done to a sannyasi or a pundit or a guru of any kind. It is a prank thatMr. Surendra Nath Banerjee taught our boys, and they might well reserve it forhim and others such as he. The Hindu style of doing honour is a profoundobeisance, the head touching the ground, and taking on to the head the dust ofthe feet of the revered person.\u201d All this is quite true, but the first person to pullSwamiji\u2019s carriage was the Raja of Ramnad, who had not been spoiled bySurendra Nath Banerjee and the example was followed by the students ofMadras.77 The Statesman and The Friend of India , quoted in The Indian Mirror, 23 February 1897 (Indian Newspapers, cited, 152-53).78 Ibid (Indian Newspapers, cited, 153c).79 Ghatanabali , cited, III, 101-7.80 The Life , cited, III, 129.81 C.W ., cited, VI, 451.82 The Amrita Bazar Patrika , 8 February 1897 (Indian Newspapers,cited, 315).83 The Life , cited, III, 125.84 C .

The memoryof what he saw and heard on the great occasion remained vivid all through hislong life (he died at the age 94 in 1966). Recalling the event, in an addressdelivered in 1956, when he was eighty-four years old, he said, \u201cI still rememberthe bright forenoon at Dakshineswar Thakur Bati and the hallowed BanyanTree, under whose umbrageous canopy stood Swami Vivekananda, in ochrecoloured robes, faery-dowered with all the gifts and graces of mind and body,smiling and delivering a speech on his return from America, \u2014 a speech, mightymouthed, eloquent, appealing to all present.

To the astonishment of the membersof the Tagore family who were present there, the Maharshi said that he hadwatched with deep satisfaction and pride the career of the Swami. He referredto many messages that the Swami had delivered from time to time. The Swamiwas highly deferential to the old man and looked as if he was very shy. Afterthe Maharshi finished speaking, the Swami asked for his blessings, which theold man gave. The Swami and Nivedita then bowed down to him and left. Atthe pressing request of some members of the family, the Swami sat down withthem for a conversation. He did not have tea which was offered to him, butaccepted a pipe. The Swami said that he considered Raja Ram Mohan Roy asthe greatest man of Modern India. This pleased his hosts very much. The talkthen turned on the use of a symbol ( pratika ) for worship, and on Kali. TheSwami expressed his opinions midway between those held by worshippers ofKali and those who were opposed to the worship. They cordially invited him tocome again and he invited them to pay a visit to Belur. A few days later, however,a letter came from Sarala Devi intimating that if Swamiji wanted the cooperationof the Brahmos, he would have to leave \u201cthe religion of Sri Ramakrishna,\u201d andthat if he did so he would receive their active help in his work. Presumably,Swamiji\u2019s letter to Sarala Devi dated 16 April 1899 was an answer to this.(Lizelle Reymond, Nivedita , cited, 267_72).145 Bhaktamalika , cited, I, 174.146 The Life , cited, III, 158.147 Ibid , 158-60.148 C.W ., cited, VII, 500-1.149 RabindraJivani , Prabhat Kumar Mukhopadhyay, II, cited, 6  et seq.150 Atiter Smriti by Swami Sraddhananda, cited, 42-43.1323151 In Vani O Rachana , IX, 55 and C.W., VI, 471, the date is givenwrongly as 19 Vaisakha, 1303 B.S. This date corresponds to 30 April 1896,when, of course, Swamiji had not yet returned to India.152 The Indian Mirror , 8 May 1897 (Indian Newspapers, cited, 199).153 C.W ., cited, VI, 488_91. Tapasvini (or Gangabai) Mataji was bornin 1835 of Maharashtrian parents at Rai Belur in Arcot District, South India,where her father was the ruler of a tiny State. From an early age she was versedin Sanskrit religious literature as well as skilled in riding, swordplay, and allmanly games. Hearing the call of God and the Motherland she left her homeand, after many adventures, came to Jhansi, and became an intimate companionof Rani Lakshmi Bai, who was a distant maternal aunt of hers. Along with hershe plunged into the conflagration of 1857, and fought bravely in her army onhorse-back, sword and lance in hand. After Lakshmi Bai\u2019s death, she fled toNepal, in the company of Nana Saheb, and spent the life of a fugitive there fornearly thirty years, practising the hardest sadhanas which probably gave herthe name Tapasvini Mata and preparing for her next mission in life, which wascarried out in Calcutta. She probably came to Calcutta in 1890 and foundedher school in 1893. She died in 1907.
